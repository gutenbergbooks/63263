<h2><span class="small">INTRODUCTION.</span></h2>
<p>When I was a school boy at Canterbury, in
the fifties and sixties, my first interest in
philology was evoked by Trench on <i>The
Study of Words</i>, and by the more elaborate
pioneer work, Isaac Taylor&rsquo;s <i>Words and Places</i>,
while oral instruction was afforded by the lectures
of Dean Alford and the class teaching of my
Headmaster, Mitchinson. All four of these
leaders having been clergymen, it is perhaps
fitting that, at a considerable distance, both of
time and of ability, another cleric should attempt
to localize some of their general teaching.</p>
<p>Becoming aware in 1920 that there was no
book dealing with the <i>Place Names of Kent</i>, such
as has been produced by individuals or small
committees in the case of some other counties,
twenty in number; finding also by correspondence
that McClure, the author of <i>British Place
Names in Their Historical Setting</i>, says &ldquo;Kent
is one of the most difficult regions in England to
trace its topographical history,&rdquo; I set to work to
read all I could that bore upon the subject.
Especially when laid up by an ailment, I read
through twenty-six volumes of <i>Arch&aelig;logia
Cantiana</i>, and found therein a productive quarry.
Then, to facilitate the future labours of those
more competent to deal fully with the subject, I
wrote a series of weekly articles in the <i>South
Eastern Gazette</i> last winter, which were found
<span class="pb" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
of interest, Mr. E. Salter Davies asking me to
write something for the <i>Kent Education Gazette</i>
to enlist the co-operation of school teachers, and
to remind them of the educational benefit to
their pupils of a study of local names.</p>
<p>In some parts of England and Wales this study
of local place names has been taken up with
enthusiasm by teachers and scholars, and in this
connexion it should be noted that the names of
every lane, house, and field and wood, should be
ascertained and recorded, even if no meaning can
be found. Names of this kind change, and the
old folk who could say why a name was given
will not be always with us. &ldquo;Terriers&rdquo; and
Tithe Maps, which can be consulted, if not borrowed,
will give more names than ordinary maps.</p>
<p>To such enquiries we may be stimulated by
shame when we know that Kent is one of the
counties without a work on its place names, and
even more by the fact that Norway has been at
work in this direction since 1896&mdash;the Church and
the State collaborating and a State grant helping
in the production of the nineteen volumes already
published. So too, in Sweden, a committee was
appointed by Royal authority in 1901, and one
province has already been dealt with exhaustively.
Denmark also from 1910, under the Ministry of
Education, and with State grants, thus recognised
the linguistic and historico-arch&aelig;ological
importance of such studies.</p>
<p>And yet none of these enlightened and progressive
kingdoms have anything like the advantage
that England possesses in its Saxon Charters and
its Domesday Book. More honour to them,
more shame to us!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_v">v</div>
<p>Let it be clearly understood, however, from the
first that I am not writing as an expert on these
matters, nor as having a direct knowledge of
Celtic or of Saxon. All I have attempted has
been simply to collect, for the benefit of those who
shall be attracted to the study of our place-names
as elucidating the ancient history of the County,
information from many sources which will save
them the time and labour of finding out for themselves
whether a particular name is old enough
to be found in Domesday Book, or in later Saxon
charters and wills; and especially there has been
in my mind the hope that a committee may be
appointed to deal as well with Kent as other
Counties have been, especially by the great
Anglo-Saxon scholars, Professor Skeats, Professor
Craigie, of Oxford, and Professor Mawer,
of Newcastle. For such literary artizans and
architects as I hope may shortly arise, I am more
than content to have been but a day labourer, a
collector of material which others may find worthy
of scrutiny and perhaps of use.</p>

<h1 title="">PLACE NAMES IN KENT.</h1>
<hr />
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Place Names of Celtic Origin.</span></span></h2>
<p>Men of Kent must not make too much
of their county motto, <i>Invicta</i>. As a
matter of fact, we have been conquered
at various times, and sometimes before the rest
of England succumbed to the invader. The
aborigines, who were probably somewhat like the
Esquimeaux, a small race, having only stone
weapons and tools, lived on the fringe of the
great glacier of the last Ice Age (perhaps 50,000
years ago), which enabled one (though doubtless
no one tried) to walk from what is now Middlesex
and Kent to the North Pole; even the present
North Sea being part of the great sheet of ice
which covered all our land down to the north
bank of the Thames. When climatic conditions
altered for the better, England (to call it by its
much later name) became desirable to the great
west-ward migration of the Celts, who had
already over-run all North Europe. This was
the first of the five great waves of peoples who
from the East seized on Europe, each driving its
predecessor westward. The Celtic is, at any
rate, the first to be clearly traced. It was divisible
into the Gadhelic and the Cymric (or Brythonic)
element, from the former the Erse, Gaelic,
and Manx languages being derived, and from the
latter the Welsh and the Breton (Ancient British
and Gaulish, the Cornish, and probably the
Pictish).</p>
<p>The first branch is said to have passed into
Britain about 800 B.C., and the second about
630 B.C. Thenceforward, but for a few place-names,
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
chiefly of rivers and heights, and still
fewer words which have survived in our tongue,
we know little until the visit of Julius C&aelig;sar in
B.C. 54, from whose <i>Gallic War</i> we learn of
some of the Celtic tribe-names and place-names.
Otherwise we know little apart from the river
roots which we find all over N. Europe (and
hardly any in England are non-Celtic), especially
the five main words for river or water&mdash;Afon&mdash;Dur&mdash;Esk&mdash;Rhe&mdash;and
Don.</p>
<p>Kent itself in the earliest records is found as
Ceant from the Celtic Cenn&mdash;a head or headland,
which again appears on the other side of our
land as the Mull of Cantire. We have also our
Chevening, which, like Chevenage, embodies the
Celtic Cefn&mdash;ridge (still Cefn in Welsh). And
&ldquo;Kits Coty House&rdquo; on our neighbouring Down
gives us Ked&mdash;a hollow, and Coit&mdash;a wood, i.e.,
the hollow dolmen in the wood. Mote Park sounds
modern enough to some; but our &ldquo;park&rdquo; is the
Celtic parwyg, an enclosed place, while the much
later Anglo-Saxon Mote denotes a place of local
assembly. Dun was their word for a hill-fort,
and so we have Croydon (with a Saxon prefix) for
the fortress on the chalk range, though most of
the old British fortresses which preserved the
name when occupied by Romans or Saxons are in
other counties. Penshurst, on the other hand,
has a Saxon suffix to the Celtic Pen, still unchanged
in Welsh as meaning a head or hill,
perhaps only a dialectic form of the Gaelic Ceann,
or Ken, which we have already noted in &ldquo;Kent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As to whether the names of Romney and
Romney Marsh have a Celtic element, opinions
differ. Isaac Taylor, in his <i>Words and Places</i>,
has little doubt that they come &ldquo;from the Gaelic
ruimne,&rdquo; a marsh, and instances Ramsey, in
the Fens, as coming from the same source, and
finds it also in Ramsgate, i.e., the passage
through an opening in the cliffs to the marshes
behind. But he wrote in 1864, and in some
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
respects is considered too imaginative by modern
philologists. Ruim is undoubtedly the British
name of Thanet&mdash;Ruoihm, or Ruoichim&mdash;preceding
Tenit, Tenitland, Thanet&mdash;so perhaps the
situation of Ramsgate in Thanet is all we have to
consider. McClure ignores &ldquo;ruimne&rdquo; as a derivation;
but does not explain the Rumin as a name
of the district. The oldest English form is in
a charter of 697 A.D. Rumining&mdash;seta, i.e., the
dwellings of the people of Rumin, and he inclines
(though admitting it may be far-fetched) to derive
from &ldquo;Roman,&rdquo; since the whole region is full of
Roman associations. Our common suffix &ldquo;den,&rdquo;
for a deep wooded valley, gives us probably a
Celtic word adopted by the conquering Jutes.
Perhaps the explanation for so few Celtic names
of places having survived is accounted for by the
thoroughness with which the invading Jutes
either slew or drove far westwards the Celts, and
so re-named whatever settlements they made.
Thus, in 452 A.D., according to the <i>Saxon
Chronicle</i>, Hengist slew 4,000 Britons at Crayford,
and these must have formed a large proportion
of the population, and this was only one of
a series of victories which drove the Celts backward
into the far west. Purely Celtic Kent was
prehistoric; Romano-Celtic it was from B.C. 55
to A.D. 413, and yet marvellously little remains
of either element.</p>
<p>This mighty race has left us little record,
though its language survives in Scotland, Ireland,
and Wales. In Maidstone Museum we can
study its weapons, its ornaments, and its
methods of sepulture; but in our walks in Kent
we are rarely reminded of its long, as well as
ancient, occupation of the soil. Yet in what we
might consider the purest English some undoubtedly
Celtic words survive, such as basket, crook,
kiln, fleam, barrow, ashlar, rasher, mattock,
bran, gown, flannel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Availing myself of what has been written by
Celtic or Saxon scholars, I turn to the river names
of Kent, of which some are obviously Celtic and
others as obviously Saxon.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Ash.</span>&mdash;The western branch of the Stour is so
named, and Ashford was anciently Esshetsford.
Rivers have sometimes been named from the
trees on their banks, and besides our Ash-ford,
we find elsewhere Ashbrook and Ashbourne;
though the common Celtic esk for water or river
may also be considered. In this connection I
note that in a direct line we have near Detling,
Boxley, Thornham, Hollingbourne (Anglo-Saxon
Holeyn is holly), possibly Bearsted from the
Saxon Berc for birch, and Ashford from Aesc,
our ash.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Brook.</span>&mdash;This later, or English, name for a
small stream appears only as a termination. We
have Cranbrook, a reminder, like Cranbourne
elsewhere, of the time when cranes were not uncommon
in England. These are the places:
Brook, a village on a tributary of the Stour;
Brookland, near a branch of the Rother; and
Brook Street, near Woodchurch. And may not
Kidbrooke, or Kedbrook, be &ldquo;the brook from the
Coed&rdquo;&mdash;the Celtic word for a wood?</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Bourne.</span>&mdash;The Anglo-Saxon Burne for stream
appears not only in the Bourne and Bourne Park,
and the various Nail-bournes, or intermittently
flowing brooks, but also in Bekesbourne, Bishopsbourne,
Patrixbourne, Littlebourne, the Ravensbourne,
Hollingbourne, Brabourne (the broad
bourne), Northbourne, and perhaps Sittingbourne,
although this is on a creek rather than a
brook.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Cray.</span>&mdash;From the Saxon Cregga, a small
brook, a tributary of the Darent or Derwent. In
457 A.D. Hengist and his son &AElig;sc (Ash, or,
metaphorically, ship) slew 4,000 Britons at
Crecganford, and drove the rest out of Kent to
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Lundenbyrg (London). So the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i>
records. Another old chronicler calls this the
battle of the Derwent. The valley of the Cray
contains the villages of Crayford, St. Paul&rsquo;s (probably
S. Paulinus&rsquo;) Cray, St. Mary&rsquo;s Cray, Foot&rsquo;s
Cray, and the district is commonly called the
Crays.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Darent.</span>&mdash;Like Dover&rsquo;s Dour, from the Celtic
root Dur for water or river, comes the Der-went,
of which Darent is a variation. Dwr-gwyn in
Welsh is the clear water. There are four Derwents
in England, besides Lake Derwent Water.
Dartford is the ford of the Darent.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Dour.</span>&mdash;The living Celtic tongues of Wales,
Ireland and Scotland preserve the Celtic Dur&mdash;Dwr
in Welsh, Dur in G&aelig;lic and Erse. There
are other Dours in Fife and Aberdeen, and the
Dover or Dur-beck in Notts, and in Sussex the
Roman itinerary gives Portum Adurni, whence it
has been assumed that there was an Adour river.
But Prichard gives forty-four ancient names containing
this root in Italy, Germany, Gaul, and
Britain.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Eden.</span>&mdash;The Eden, on which is Edenbridge, is
a tributary of the Medway. Various rivers of this
name are found also in Cumberland, Yorks, Fife
and Roxburgh, containing the Celtic root Dan,
Don, or Den, for water or river.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Lee.</span>&mdash;This is a brook rising at Eltham Place,
and giving its name to Lee Street and Lee, thence
flowing to Lewisham. The more important river
Lea on the opposite side of the Thames is called
Lygan in the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i>. In Essex also
there is the Lea-beck, which shows a Celtic name
with a suffix attributable to the Danish marauders
whose becks are more common in the north of
England. The dropping of the last syllable of
Lygan would give the Lee.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Len.</span>&mdash;This short tributary of the Medway has
been neglected by writers on place-names; but it
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
might be the Celtic Levn, smooth, as in Loch
Leven and three rivers of that name in Scotland,
besides others in Gloucestershire, Yorks, Cornwall,
Cumberland, and Lancashire.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Medway.</span>&mdash;The first syllable is adjectival, like
the Tam (broad or still) in Tamesa or Thames,
and is the Celtic Mwg, vapour, whence our
&ldquo;muggy.&rdquo; The second is from a varying Celtic
root, represented in Welsh by gwy or wy, for
water. Most of the river-names from this root are
in Wales; but besides the Medway there is the
Solway, on the Scottish border, and such names
as Weymouth and Weybridge. In the <i>Saxon
Chronicle</i> it is spelled Medew&aelig;gan. Worth recording
(if only to discard them) are some derivations
given in Ferguson&rsquo;s <i>River Names</i>. Writing
in 1862 (since when some study has been more
scientific), he gives the suggestion of the German,
Grimm, that the name refers to a cup of mead
overturned by a river god! Also that Gibson&rsquo;s
<i>Etymological Geography</i> derives it from the
Latin medius because the river flows through the
middle of Kent! and this, says Gibson, is the
usual acceptation. Ferguson throughout has
Sanscrit on the brain, and so refers us to a
Sanscrit root, mid, to soften, and thinks it named
from its gentle flow. But which of our Kentish
rivers are not gentle?</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Quaggy.</span>&mdash;One of the two brooks at Lewisham.
Quag may be the same as Quag in quagmire, and
the second syllable the Anglo-Saxon &ldquo;ea&rdquo; for
water or river, cognate with the old High German
&ldquo;aha&rdquo; and the Latin &ldquo;aqua.&rdquo; In Rosetti&rsquo;s
poem we find &ldquo;I fouled my feet in quag-water.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Ravensbourne.</span>&mdash;When Teutonic colonists or
invaders, dispossessing the Celts, inquired the
name of a stream, they took the Celtic word to
be a proper instead of a common name, and so
added their own name for water or river.
Later, when the English tongue was evolved,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
&ldquo;water&rdquo; was sometimes added to the Celtic, or
Celtic-plus-Saxon, name. Thus, in Wansbeck-water,
Wan is Alfon and Evon; S is a vestige of
the Gadhelic visge; Beck is the Norse addition;
and Water the later English when it was forgotten
what Wansbeck meant. Thus our present
name means River-water-river-water! So
Ravensbourne (interpreted inanely in a Lewisham
print by a legend of a raven and a bone) is really
the Celtic Avon, with the Saxon addition of
Bourne, so common in Kent for stream.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Rother.</span>&mdash;A mainly Sussex stream which
forms part of the boundary of Kent. It is said
to be the Celtic Rhud-dwr&mdash;that is Red Water.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Stour.</span>&mdash;There are other rivers of this name in
Suffolk, Dorset, Warwickshire, and Worcestershire,
besides the St&ouml;r in Holstein, the Stura, a
tributary of the Po, and the Stura (now the Store)
in Italy, all probably named from the union of
two Celtic words for water, Is and Dwr. Some
regard it as merely the intensitive of Dwr, as in
Welsh the prefix Ys is used to intensify. Note
that a unique river name is a rarity.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Swale.</span>&mdash;Bede, the Saxon historian, writes of
the baptisms by S. Paulinus, in the Sualua. This
is the Swale, which makes Sheppey an island.
There are the East and the West Swale and
Swalecliff, and the origin may be from the Anglo-Saxon
Swellan, to swell. There are other
Swales in Britain and Germany.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Thames.</span>&mdash;This means the Broad, or Still,
Water, from the Celtic adjective Tam and the
root Is for water, which is reduplicated in the
name Isis for the river at Oxford, higher than
where the Thames falls into it. There is a river
Tame in four of our counties.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Wantsum.</span>&mdash;This much-dwindled stream
separates Thanet from the mainland, and is called
Wantsumu by Bede. The word is said to be not
Celtic (as are most river names here and on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
Continent); but Teutonic. Want or Went, meant
a Way, and Som had the same qualifying force
as in the word &ldquo;winsome,&rdquo; that is, equivalent to
the &ldquo;able&rdquo; in &ldquo;lovable.&rdquo; There is a Wensum,
a tributary of the Yare, near Norwich. While
in early days the north branch of the Stour by
Thanet was not fordable, this water was &ldquo;go-able&rdquo;&mdash;to
coin a word. The &ldquo;way&rdquo; is not necessarily
a water way. At Ightham, Seven Vents is
the name of a place where seven roads meet.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Yenlade</span> or <span class="sc">Yenlet</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;Applied by Lewis to
the north and south mouths of the estuary of the
Wantsum, which made Thanet an island. The
A.S. gen-lad means a discharging of a river into
the sea, or a smaller river into one larger.&rdquo; Ladan
or hladan means to load or lade. Lambarde
wrote in 1570 &ldquo;Yenlade or yenlet betokeneth an
Indraught or Inlett of water into the land.&rdquo;
There are two or three places of this name in the
mouth of the Thames. Yantlet Creek is in the
Isle of Grain.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Beult.</span>&mdash;The final t is not found in the earliest
records I have seen, where the name is Beule.
One of our best Kent arch&aelig;ologists suggests the
Saxon verb Beauland, to turn or twist, as the
origin. I think, however, we may go further
back and find no exception to the rule that most
of our rivers were named by the Celts, for I find
the Erse or Irish Buol or Biol for water, and in
addition to Continental rivers which contain this
root there is the Buil (now called the Boyle) in
Ireland, the Beela in Westmorland, and the
Beauly in Inverness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Roman Names in Kent.</span></span></h2>
<p>The first appearance of Kent in history is in
the Gallic War of Julius C&aelig;sar, who paid
us the compliment of saying, <i>Ex his omnibus,
longe sunt humanissimi qui Cantium
incolunt</i>, on which Shakespeare wrote, &ldquo;Kent
in commentaries C&aelig;sar writ, Is termed
the civil&rsquo;st place in all the isle.&rdquo; Of his
presence here, however, the only relic is
perhaps more in the realm of legend than of history.
There is a mound or barrow at Chilham
known as Julaber&rsquo;s or Juliberry&rsquo;s grave, which
has been referred to Julius Laberius, an officer of
Julius C&aelig;sar, slain in a battle here against the
British Celts. Julius C&aelig;sar left our shores 54
B.C., and our history is a blank until A.D. 43
(roughly for a hundred years) when the Emperor
Claudius came to conquer us, in which campaign
Titus took a part, who in A.D. 70 captured
Jerusalem&mdash;as later some Detling young men entered
Jerusalem under General Allenby! Kent and
the Thames tribes were first conquered, and in
the occupation of Britain from A.D. 43 to A.D.
418 it was the rest of the country which gave
military work to the Romans.</p>
<p>Considering this long occupation, ended only
by the necessary recall of the troops to defend
falling Rome, it is surprising that so few place-names,
not only in Kent but anywhere, are attributable
to our masters. Those usually instanced
are Speen (anciently Spin&aelig;, thorns); Pontefract
(the broken bridge); Chester (Castra, a camp),
with its later derivations, the Anglian Caster and
the Saxon Chester; and Caerleon (Castra
Legionum&mdash;the camp of the Legions); and of
these not one is in Kent. The chief centres of the
sparse population, and the natural landmarks of
rivers and mountains, preserved the names given
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
earlier by the Celts, while our villages with few
exceptions are Scandinavian or Teutonic, otherwise
Norse or Saxon. Prof. Green, in his <i>History
of the English People</i>, is doubtless right in saying
that &ldquo;only in the great towns were the
Britons Romanized. The tribes of the rural districts
remained apart, speaking their own tongue
and owing some traditional allegiance to their
native chiefs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kent had more than its share of the mighty
road-making of Rome; more than its share
(except in the turbulent northern boundary of
England) of Roman military stations; but though
the roads remain, forts are only bits of ruins or
foundations, and the names have perished or been
changed. So, too, in Kent were most of the nine
Roman ports put under the jurisdiction of the
Comes Littoris Saxonici. In the Antonine
Itinerary of the fourth century the route from the
Northern Wall in Dumfriesshire to our Richborough
has as its last station Londonio (London),
Noviomago (site unknown), 10 miles; Vigniacis
(? Springhead), 18 miles; Durobrivis (Rochester),
9 miles; Durolevo (? near Sittingbourne), 13
miles; Duroverno (Canterbury), 12 miles; and
Rutupis (Richborough), 12 miles. In no case has
the Roman name survived, with the exception
of the twisted Rutupis, for Lundon-ium is the old
name adopted by the Romans. Other routes add
Dubris (Dover), 14 miles from Duroverno, and
Portus Limanis (Lympne), 16 miles from Dubris.
Where we find Street it is, of course, the Saxon
form of the Roman Strata Via, <i>i.e.</i>, paved road,
and so our Kentish Stone Street ran from the
fortified port (as it was then, though inland now)
of Lympne to Canterbury; and Watling Street
(the name still surviving in London and Canterbury)
from their other fortified ports of Rutupi&aelig;
(Richborough) to Canterbury, London, Stony
Stratford, and Chester. But Watling is not
Latin, and in the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i> the name is
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
W&aelig;clingastr&aelig;t. So, too, the Well Street which
ran from Maidstone into the Weald&mdash;with no
definite end&mdash;is the road in the Wald, or Weald,
forest. We may perhaps add the places ending
in &ldquo;hall&rdquo; as a relic of the Roman aula. These
are more common in Thanet and Romney Marsh
than elsewhere, and in both these places Romans
had much to do.</p>
<p>The names given to the two Roman fortresses
which guarded the Wantsum (then an important
water way), Regulbium and Rutupi&aelig;, were hard
for Saxon lips, and so were changed into Raculf-cestre,
whence Reculvers, and Repta-caester,
later Ratesburgh, whence our Richborough. So
also the Roman name of Rochester&mdash;Durobrevis
(the stronghold of the bridges) became in Saxon
times, Roribis, then Hrofibrevi. This was shortened
into Hrofi, which again was later assumed
to be the name of a man, and so Bede (twelve
hundred years ago) gives us Hrofes-c&aelig;ster,
whence our Rochester.</p>
<p>Chislet, however, earlier Cistelet, probably
preserves the Roman Casteletum, a small castle
or camp. And Cheriton (there are others in
other counties) is said to be derived as to its
first two syllables from cerasus, cherry, the
Romans having introduced this tree about A.D.
60. They also brought the plum&mdash;prunes&mdash;and
so we get our Plumstede for Plumstead, adjoining
Woolwich, and Plumford, in Ospringe.</p>
<p>Also where Wick as a termination is not the
Scandinavian Wic or Bay, and so a coastal
name, it comes from the Latin Vicus, a row of
houses, and is the Saxonised form. Thus our
West Wickham, Wickhambreux, Sheldwich,
and so forth, record how the Saxons adopted but
changed the name given by the Romans.
McClure suggests that Faversham (Fefres-ham
in 811, Febresham in 858, and Faversham in
Domesday) may be a survival of the Latin Faber,
smith, in the most Latinized part of Kent, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
on their chief road. The first part of the word
is plainly a genitive case, and there seems to be
no similar Saxon designation.</p>
<p>On the Continent, as well as in England, the
name Ventum, or Venta, is the Latin for a
market or sale place. Venta Silurum, for
example, has now as its neighbour Chepstow,
<i>i.e.</i>, Ceapstow, the Market. Having lived for
eight years as a boy in Wincheap, outside the
walls of Canterbury, it occurs to me that Win
may be Ven from Ventum, while cheap gives the
Saxon synonym. Its earlier forms are Wencheape,
Wyndcheps, and Wincheapfield. Of
course, it looks like winemarket, but would the
Romans have had one? And, if so, would it
not have been within the walls? On the other
hand, vineyards&mdash;probably first started by the
Romans&mdash;were not uncommon much later in
Kent, several near Maidstone, and one&rsquo;s estimation
of the pleasantness of wine from outdoor
grapes is increased by finding in old charters
that in some cases tenants were bound to bring
to an abbot or a lord of the manor &ldquo;a bushel of
blakenberis.&rdquo; This would sweeten and colour
the English port!</p>
<p>Few, indeed, are the verbal relics of the
Romans, though they were here for 400 years.
While the earlier Celts have bequeathed to us
many words and names, but few works, the
Romans left us few words but some mighty
works.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Teutonic (Jutish) Names in Kent.</span></span></h2>
<p>The Romans who had conquered, ruled,
and exploited our land for four centuries,
departed in A.D. 411, owing to the dire
necessity of defending their own land against
the Goths from Northern Europe. Already here
they had been attacked and pressed southwards
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
by the Picts of the Highlands, aided by the Scots
of Ireland. To avoid Pictish conquest the
Britons offered land and pay to the English, who
up to then had been aiding the Picts.</p>
<p>Who were these English? A long peninsula
runs northwards (as few do) from Denmark, and
separates the North Sea from the Baltic. Herein,
our real home or cradle, dwelt three tribes of
the Low German stock, Angles, Jutes, and
Saxons, and as to Kent it was the Jutes from
Jutland who, under Hengist and Horsa, in A.D.
449, landed at Ebbsfleet in Thanet, as did others
in the Isle of Wight, the Islands in both cases
forming a great naval and military station, from
which the hinterlands of Kent and Hants could
be overrun. The later, and larger, seizures of
the Saxons were all the southern counties,
Essex, Sussex, Middlesex, and Wessex, while
the sphere of the Angles spread upwards from
what we still call East Anglia. Quarrels with
these mercenaries arose as to pay, and the Britons
of Kent resolved to fight. Hrofesceastre
was too strong, and so southward turned
Hengist along the Celtic country by Kits Coty
House, and then swooped down on Aylesford
and won a battle which meant the winning of
England. Horsa fell in the moment of victory,
and the flint heap of Horsted preserves his
name, and has been held to mark his grave.
Kentish landowners fled to France; the British
labourers to the vast forest; churches gave no
sanctuary, for the heathen Jutes raged most
against the clergy.</p>
<p>And so for two centuries the war of dispossession
and slaughter went on, until Britain was
a land, not of Britons, but of Englishmen
(Angles, or Anglo-Saxons, as they are also
called), while even of their language, as we have
seen, few words lingered. Six years later the
shore-castles of Dover, Richborough, and
Lympne succumbed. Then, in A.D. 447, another
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
tribe, the Saxons, came for a share in the goodly
spoil, overran Anderida, the fortress of the
great forest, and &ldquo;slew all that were herein, nor
was there afterwards one Briton left,&rdquo; at any
rate, in Kent. This Saxon, or strictly speaking,
Jutish, invasion has given us most of our blood,
and the greater part of our tongue, our territorial
divisions, most names of places, and those
of the days of the week.</p>
<p>Following the conquerors came colonists, and
in the Saxon districts of England (and Kent is
the most Saxon of all) we find the names, not
of individual immigrants, but of families or
clans. These family settlements are denoted by
the termination <i>ing</i>, which was the usual Anglo-Saxon
patronymic, corresponding to our later
&ldquo;son&rdquo; in Johnson, etc. So the sons of Charles
Brown, who died in Detling, would in earlier
days be called the Brownings&mdash;as the progeny
of a duck are ducklings, and of a goose goslings.
It has been held that when the suffix
ham or ton is added it denotes a filial colony or
offshoot from the original settlement of the clan.
There are between two and three thousand
places in England which contain the root &ldquo;ing,&rdquo;
although some (mainly in the north) come from
a Norse and substantive &ldquo;eng&rdquo; or &ldquo;ing&rdquo; which
means meadow. Kemble makes 22 original settlements
in Kent, and 29 filial offshoots, whereas
the western or northern counties have no original,
although, between them, 169 filial settlements.</p>
<p>If we may thus distinguish two classes of place
names which survive in Kent, we have the Bobbings
at Bobbing, the H&ocirc;cings at Hucking, the
Harlings at Harling, the Boerlings at Barling,
the Berlings at Birling, the Bollings at Bowling,
the Garlings at Garlinge, the Hallings at Halling,
the Hircelings at Hecklinge, the Horings
at Herringe, the Mollings at Mailing, the Wealings
at Welling, the Beltings at Beltring, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
Cerrings at Charing, the Petlings at Pedling,
the Wickings at Witchling, the Bermarings at
Barming. In one case, however, an individual
is commemorated in a place-name&mdash;Hemmings
Bay, near Margate, is the scene of the landing
of a Danish chieftain in 1009 A. D. There were
many Saxons in Thanet under Roman rule (as
interments have shown), but few place names
are found there of the patronymic kind, the exceptions
being Garlinge, Birchington, Halling
Court, Osinghelle, Ellington, and Newington&mdash;of
which some are doubtful. What about
Detling? one of my readers may say. I inclined
for some time to the meaning deep meadow (as
Deptford is the deep fiord or bay), in allusion to
its position between the vast forest above and
the extensive marshes below; but Mr. McClure
will not hear of &ldquo;ing&rdquo; a meadow, in the South
of England, and one Oxford Professor of Anglo-Saxon
writes me as follows: &ldquo;The evidence for
ing &lsquo;meadow,&rsquo; south of Lincolnshire is so scanty
or dubious that it would require pretty strong
evidence to establish its recurrence in Kent
place-names.&rdquo; In that case one must fall back
upon a Saxon ancestor, and lately in Maidstone
were found both Major D&rsquo;Aeth and Mr. De&rsquo;Ath,
whose families would be Deathlings in early
Saxon days.</p>
<p>Then, of offshoots, we have in Kent the
&AElig;lingtons at Allington, the Ellings at Ellington,
the Aldings at Aldington, the Eorpings at
Orpington, the Bennings at Boddington, the
Gillings at Gillingham, the Cennings at Kennington,
the Cosings at Cossington, the Dodings
at Doddington, the D&oelig;fings at Davington, the
Leasings at Lossenham, the P&oelig;fings at Pevington,
the Syfings at Sevington, the Wickings at
Wickinghurst, the Lodings at Loddington, the
Ellings at Ellington, the Bosings at Bossingden
(and Bossenden), the Adings at Addington, the
&OElig;slings at Ashlingham, and possibly the
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
Beecings at Birchington and Beckenham. As
illustrating the westward migration of the Teutonic
race we may note, to take one clan, that,
starting from Germany, the Hemings name
Hemingen in Germany, Hemminghausen in
Westphalia, Hemingstadt in Holstein, Heming
in Lorraine and in Alsace, Hemington in Northamptonshire
and Somerset, and Hemingbrough
in Yorks.</p>
<p>It may help some in their enquiry into the
origin of place-names if I note that of old, and
by Saxon lips, the vowel &ldquo;e&rdquo; was pronounced
like our &ldquo;a.&rdquo; So, in the case of Berfreystone,
Berham, Bernefield, Chert, Chertham, Crey,
Dertford, Esseherst, Essetlesford, Freningham,
Herietsham, Herty, Hertleye, Hese, Mergate,
Remmesgate, Reyersh, Smeredenne, and Werehorne&mdash;the
vowel sound remaining although the
vowel was changed when, for example, Hese
became our Hayes. And another point is that
in the Kentish dialect th (a separate character in
Saxon) often becomes d, <i>e.g.</i>, gardering for
gathering, and dare and dem for there and them.
This still survives in remote places and aged
persons. So Beddersden for Bethersden.</p>
<p>I may here add some instances of what in
some cases aids, and in other cases hinders,
a knowledge of the origin and meaning of a
place-name&mdash;that is the very various ways in
which the name has been spelled. Generally,
the earlier the form the better guide to the
meaning. It will be found that spelling was
often so vague that even a lawyer in writing an
old record or will may spell a name differently
in the same document, and in most cases in
medi&aelig;val times the sound of the word ruled its
spelling. Some examples of multiform names in
Kent I give here.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Edenbridge.</span>&mdash;Edeling-bridge, 1225, Ethonbrigge
1457, Edonbregge 1473, Edinbregg and
Edingbregg 1483, Etonbrigge 1499, Etonbreg
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
1528, Etonbridge 1534, Edulwestbridge 1539,
with other forms of which I have not noted the
dates, Edelmesbrigge, Pons Edelmi. The bridge
element is clear throughout, but it would also
seem that the old name of the river Eden was
the Edel. Of this there may be evidence which
I have not yet come across.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Bethersden</span> in its earliest form is Beatrichesdenne
(1194), which, on the analogy of other
places, would seem to point to the church being
dedicated to a local S. Beatrice; but at the same
date, and since, its patron saint was S. Margaret.
Possibly an heiress Beatrice held the
manor, as Patrixbourne is called, not from the
saint of the Church, but from one who held
the manor, which in Domesday was simply
called Bourne. Later I find Beterisdenne 1389,
Betrycheden 1468, Betresden 1535, Beatherisden
1552, and later Beathersden, Beddersden (by
Kent dialect change of th into d), and Bethersden.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Charing</span> is Ciorminege in a Saxon charter of
799 A.D., which proved too hard for old English
or middle English mouths, so that one finds
many later variants, such as Cheerynge 1396,
Carings, Cerringes (and Cherinche in Domesday
Book 1036), Cherrving (temp. Edw. 3rd), and at
last Charing in 1505.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Cuxton</span>, probably derived from a personal
name, like Cuckfield in Sussex, is Codestane in
Domesday, Coklestone 1472, Cokston 1503,
Cokynston 1533, Coxston 1538, Cokestone 1559,
and Codstan, Coklestane, Colestane, Cukelstane,
and Cookstone in other documents.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Goodneston</span>, near Ash and Wingham, is no
doubt Goodwin&rsquo;s Town, and once had the name
of &ldquo;Godstanstone-les-Elmes, alias Nelmes, near
Wingham.&rdquo; In 1208 it was Gutsieston, but in
1512 had settled down into Godenston, previous
variations having been Goldstaneston, Gounceston,
Groceston, Gusseton, and Guston.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Saxon or Jutish Suffixes.</span></span></h2>
<p>In the earliest days of which we have knowledge
all Kent was practically either forest
or marsh, with a little cornland in Thanet
and sheep pastures in Sheppey, and it was
plainly on the edges of the forests (Blean and
Anderida running right across the county from
Whitstable to Cranbrook) that the early settlers
from Jutland made their homes. Like pioneer
backwoodsmen in Canada and elsewhere, they
had first to clear of trees, and then to fence, the
spot each family had chosen. For 25 years I
have passed annually through the agricultural
districts of Belgium, Alsace, Lorraine, and
Switzerland (and sometimes France), and two
things always strike me&mdash;that English agriculturists
are not on the whole so thrifty, so tidy,
or so hardworking, as their Continental brethren,
and that abroad they seem to have neither need
nor desire for hedges or other fences. Our
colonists in England, however, show in place-names
how necessary they thought enclosures
to be.</p>
<p>First there is the ubiquitous &ldquo;<i>ton</i>&rdquo; as a suffix.
The sons of &AElig;lla, the Ellings, made their Ellington.
Now &ldquo;ton&rdquo; means an enclosure, and
especially enclosed land with a dwelling thereon.
Then it comes to signify the house on the enclosure.
In Scotland even now the &ldquo;toun&rdquo; is
the farmhouse and outbuildings, and in Kent I
find in a charter of 1432 a conveyance of &ldquo;land
with all Houses ... called Wattyshagh, formerly
called Taune.&rdquo; Then, as the original
house became a nucleus, and a hamlet swelled
into a village, and a village into a town, we got
our modern sense of the word, which, however,
is later than the Norman conquest.</p>
<p>Even earlier than &ldquo;ton&rdquo; would be &ldquo;<i>field</i>,&rdquo;
which is not the same as lea or mead, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
denotes a patch of felled or cleared land. So
we have our Chelsfield, Oakfield, Ifield, Broomfield,
Whitfield, Swingfield, Fairfield, Hothfield,
Stalisfield, Clexfield, Longfield, Fieldgreen, and
Netherfield, in the more forestal part of Kent,
while in the list of parishes in the Rochester
diocese, where marsh and down prevailed, I find
only one parish&mdash;Matfield&mdash;which suggests old
felling of trees. Sometimes, however, there
would be attractive glades or <i>leys</i> on the outskirts
of the forest, already pastured or cultivated
to a certain extent. Hence arose not only
place-names, but nick-names (sur-names came
much later) of persons who lived or worked
therein, such as John of the Horse Ley, John of
the Cow Ley, John of the Sheep Ley, John of
the Swine Ley, which later became surnames.
Isaac Taylor enumerates 22 leys in Central Kent,
but one cannot test his figures without knowing
what map he used. Hence as place-names our
Hartley, Swanley, Langley, Bromley, Oakley or
Ockley, Hockley, Bickley, Whitley, Boxley,
Mydley, Barley, Brenchley, Elmley, Ripley,
Angley, Beverley, Gorseley Wood, Harley,
Pluckley, Throwley, Bexley, Leybourne, Shirley,
Kelmsley, Ridley, Tudeley, etc.</p>
<p>Then there were, and are, the <i>Dens</i>, forty-two
of them in Central Kent, says Isaac Taylor;
but Mr. Furley, in his <i>Weald of Kent</i>, says that
the great manor of Aldington alone possessed
forty-four dens. It was probably a Celtic word
adopted by the Saxons, and designated a wooded
valley mostly used for swine pasture. So we
have the Ardenne forest in France and Belgium,
and elsewhere in England Henley in Arden and
the Forest of Arden, which stretched from
Gloucestershire to Nottingham. Down to the
17th century the &ldquo;Court of the Dens&rdquo; was held
at Aldington, near Hythe, to determine pasture
rights and wrongs.</p>
<p>One cannot enumerate all the Kentish dens
which might be found not only on the map but
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
in old manorial records. In old Tenterden alone
there were Pittesden, Igglesden, Strenchden,
Godden, Gatesden, Bugglesden, Finchden,
Twisden, Lovedene, Haffendene, Brissendene,
Haldene, and Little Haldene as manors, of some
of which even the names have departed. I find
that of the 16 parishes in the rural deanery of
West Charing eight end in den and five in hurst,
and I think Furley is in error when he says that
only 16 extant parishes (as distinct from manors)
in Kent end in den. A small original settlement
in a den might soon increase in size even in
early Saxon times, and so we have several
parishes and manors called Denton. Other
local place-names which are due to their position
in the old forest land are those which end in
<i>hyrst</i> or, later, hurst. Hursts and Cherts were
the denser parts of the forest, and the word is
said to apply specially to wooded high ground.
The two words may be originally the same, with
the old German Hart (whence the Hartz mountains),
as parent. So we have Bredhurst, Goudhurst,
Hawkhurst, Hurst Wood near Peckham,
Penshurst, Sandhurst, Staplehurst, Chart, and
two or three score more.</p>
<p>Another forest name is <i>Holt</i> or Hot&mdash;more
common in Surrey than in Kent. The German
is Holtz, which means both a wood and wood
the material. It is also a common prefix or
suffix in Iceland. Isaac Taylor gives us only
one Holt in his table, for Central Kent at any
rate, but we know Knockholt beeches, Birchholt
near Smeeth, an Acholt (Oakwood) in each of
the manors of Dartford, Wingham, and Monkton,
and Hot Wood; while further study is
necessary to determine whether from Holt or
from Hoath or Hoth (a heath) come Hothfield,
Oxenhoath, and Hoath or Hoad near Reculver.
&ldquo;Another common suffix in the neighbourhood
of ancient forests,&rdquo; says Isaac Taylor, &ldquo;is
Hatch&mdash;a hitch-gate, H&ecirc;che in French.&rdquo; He
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
gives no example from Kent, but we know our
Chartham Hatch, Ivy Hatch, and Mersham
Hatch and Snoll Hatch. <i>Wold</i> or Weald, a
wood, is not so common as one would expect,
but we have Sibertswold and Wymynswold, and
Waltham and Waldershare. <i>Sn&oelig;d</i> is a Saxon
word for a piece of wood in 8th century charters,
and this survives in Hamersnoth near Romney,
Nod Wall near Lydd, Frisnoth near Appledore,
Sibersnode in the Hundred of Ham, Snode Hill,
Snodehurst, Snodland, and Snodebeam, a manor
in Yalding.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Some Common Saxon Elements in Place-Names.</span></span></h2>
<p>&mdash;<span class="smaller">HAM</span> = Ham means homestead, but&mdash;hamm
an enclosure or bend in a river, the former being
the more common. It is only by early Saxon
documents that we can tell which word is meant.
Alkham for the first, perhaps the Hundred of
Ham for the latter.</p>
<p class="tb">&mdash;<span class="smaller">ING</span>, in the middle or end of a name means
&ldquo;sons of.&rdquo; A final ling is also a patronymic
when the name ends in ol or ele. Thus Donnington
is the settlement of the sons of Donna,
and as Didling or Dudelyng in Sussex (with 13th
century forms of Dedling and Dedlinge) was
derived from Dyddeling as descendants of
Dyddel, this may throw some light on Detling
in Kent.</p>
<p class="tb">&mdash;<span class="smaller">MERE</span> = lake, or gem&aelig;ru boundary. Lakes
are few in Kent, so Baddlesmere may indicate a
boundary, while Mereworth (anciently Marewe)
may indicate neither. Mearesflete in Thanet,
and Mere, a manor in Rainham, may point to a
personal name. Walmer is said to be named
from the marshy ground behind the Wall, or old
raised beach, which begins by Walmer Castle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Br&#333;c</span> = a brook, as in the dialects of Kent and
Sussex, also low-lying ground, not necessarily
with running water. So Brook, and Brookland,
and Kidbrook.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Burna</span> = stream. So Bourne, Littlebourne,
etc.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Cnoll</span> = hillock (Cnol in Welsh and kn&ouml;l in
Swedish). So Knole, and perhaps Knockholt.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Cop</span> = a top or head, German kopf. Our Copt
Point.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cumb</span>, or comb = a hollow in a hillside, or a
narrow valley. So Ulcombe. A word borrowed
from the Celtic.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Dell</span> = low ground or valley. Hence Deal.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">&#274;&#257;</span> = water, river. So Stur-ea, now Sturry,
or watery land. So probably Romney, from
Ruimea. But ey also is &#299;&#275;g, or &#275;g = an island.
Sceapige, now Isle of Sheppey.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Denu</span> is a valley, and denn a retreat, but these
often interchange in early forms with dun, which
survives in our downs, and Down, the village.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Ford.</span>&mdash;Here we have to distinguish between
the Saxon ford (a natural place-name when
bridges as yet were few), and fiord, which is
purely coastal, and comes from our Norse
marauders. Thus Ashford and Deptford come
from quite different words.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Gr&#257;f</span>, in Saxon, is our grove, so that Ashgrove
is pure Saxon, &AElig;sc-graf.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Heall</span> means a hall, or larger house, and may
be simply the Latin aula, especially as place-names
ending in hall are more frequent near
Roman centres. But there is also halk, a corner
or angle, which may suit other places. Our
several Whitehalls would indicate the former
word.</p>
<p class="tb">The Saxon <span class="smaller">HEATH</span> survives unaltered in some
cases, and also as Hoath, and perhaps as Hoth
in Hothfield.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Hlinc</span>, a slope, accounts for the Linch and
Linchfield in Detling, a cultivated slope at the
foot of the Downs. More common in Sussex.
Golfers will recognise the word.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">H&#333;h</span> = a hough or heel of land, whence our
Hundred of Hoo.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Hyrcg</span> is our ridge, and names Eridge, and
Colbridge, and Sundridge.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Hyll</span> = our hill, partly names many places,
Bosehill, Hinxhill, Maze Hill, Ide Hill, etc.; but
I think there are more in Sussex, where Roberts
enumerates forty-eight.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Mersc</span> = march&mdash;whence Stodmarsh, Burmarsh,
Mersham, Westmarsh, Marshton.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Ofer</span> and <span class="sc">Ora</span> are difficult to distinguish in use,
the former meaning bank or shore and the latter
bank of a stream. Bilnor and Oare may come
from the former, and Bicknor and Denover (on
the Beult) from the latter.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Ell</span>, <span class="smaller">WIELL</span>, <span class="smaller">WYLL</span>, as a prefix, becomes our
well.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Wudu</span> = wood. So Saltwood is Sautwud in
1230.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Beorg</span> = a hill, dative beorge, is easily confused
with <span class="sc">Burg</span> = bush, dative byrg, a fortified
place, and then a city. From the former we get
our modern beogh, ber or barrow; from the
latter our prefix Bur, and the suffixes borough,
burg, boro, and bury. The first syllable of
Bearsted may be either Beorg or Beorc, birch.
Canterbury is the burg or fortified city of the
Cantwara or Kent-folk.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Hlu</span> = a burial mound, developing later into
the suffix low, lane, and lew, may be found in
Hadlow, and perhaps in the Hundreds of
Ryngelo and Cornilo in the Lathe of Borowart
(now S. Augustine&rsquo;s).</p>
<p class="tb">Considering the mainly forestal character of
Saxon Kent, it is not strange that many places
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
are named from trees. Thus Ac = oak, appears
in Ockholt, Ackhanger, Ockley. &AElig;sc in Ashford,
Ashhurst, and several Ashes. Our Nursted
was Nutstede earlier. Perhaps to Ac also we
may refer Hocker&rsquo;s Lane in Detling as a prefix
to another Saxon word, ofer, a shore or bring,
though it may also be but a corruption of Oakham.
In numerous place-names, especially those
derived from trees, we find this suffix: Oakover
(in Derbyshire), Ashover, Haselover, Birchover,
commonly shortened into Oaker, Asher, Hasler,
and Bircher. So the lane near the oak-tree or
oak-wood would be Oakover Lane, Oaker or
Ocker Lane, and eventually Hocker&rsquo;s Lane.
With but one cottage in it, I can find no tradition
or trace of any personal name from which
it might be called.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Apuldor</span>, as for appletree, remains in Appledore;
Birce or beorc, perhaps in Bearsted, Birchington (?),
Bekehurst.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Box</span>, or byxe (derived from the Latin buxus)
names many places, and early forms in Bex,
Bix, Bux, are found both as to Boxley and
Bexley, as with Boxhill and Bexhill in other
counties.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Holegn</span> = holen, adj. of holly, survives in
Hollingbourne and Holborough; <span class="sc">Per</span> (pear) in
Perhamstead; <span class="sc">Cherry</span> in Cheriton; <span class="sc">Plum</span> in
Plumstead; <span class="sc">Elm</span> in Elmley, Elmstone, Elmstead,
but only the wych-elm was indigenous,
and called Wice by the Saxons. <span class="sc">Thorn</span> we find
in Thornham.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Haga</span>, a Saxon name survives in our <span class="sc">Haw</span>thorn,
and may help us to understand the meaning
of Eythorne, near Dover, and the Hundred
of Eyhorne, in which Detling is situated. The
early name of Eythorne is Hegythorne, <i>i.e.</i>, Hawthorn,
and the Hundred of Eythorde or Eyhorne
(so from 1347 A.D.) might well be the same,
and named from the hamlet of Iron Street is
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
Hollingbourne, where Iron is plainly a late corruption
of an old word.</p>
<p class="tb">The Rev. E. McClure, in his <i>British Place-Names</i>,
gives (p. 207 <i>et seqq.</i>) a list of words in
old Saxon glossaries, ranging from the 7th to
the 9th centuries, which appear in British place-names.
I extract those which seem to apply to
place-names in Kent.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Bodan</span> = bottom, common in Kent for a
narrow valley, <i>e.g.</i>, East Bottom at Kingsdown,
near Walmer.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">H&oelig;gu-thorn</span> = hedge-thorn, hawthorn, whence
our Eythorne (anciently Hegythe Thorne), Hundred
of Eyhorne (Haythorn, temp. Henry III.),
and Iron Street, a hamlet in Hollingbourne in
that Hundred.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Mapuldur</span> = maple-tree, in our Maplescombe,
<i>i.e.</i>, the bowl-shaped valley where maples
abound.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Holegn</span> = holly. Our Hollingbourne, and perhaps
Hollandon.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Holt-hona</span> = woodcock, or more exactly woodhen,
like moorhen. Worhona is Saxon for
pheasant. So our Henhurst, Henwood, and
Hengrove are the same.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Boece</span> = beech. So our Mark Beech and
Bough Beech, near Chiddingstone. This derivation
is also one of those suggested for Bearsted,
whereof the Saxon name is Beorhham-stede, and
the first syllable would be either Beorg-hill or
Beorc-beech.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Goss</span> = furze. Gorsley Wood, in Bishopsbourne.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Fleota</span> = estuary or creek. Our Northfleet,
Southfleet, Ebbsfleet, and Mearesflete, and
Flete.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Haesl</span> = hazel. Hazelwood Hill, in Boughton
Malherbe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Beber</span> = beaver. Beavers flourished in England
even in historical times, and gave their
name to Beverley, Beaverbrook, etc. May
Beaver, near Ashford, derive thus? And the
Beverley at Canterbury?</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Pearroc</span> = literally a grating&mdash;a place fenced
in for deer, etc. So Park and Paddock. Paddock
Wood.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Hreed</span> = reed. Our Reedham possibly; but it
is not on marshy ground.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Hythae</span> = a harbour. Our Hythe, Greenhythe,
New Hythe (East Malling), Small Hythe (Tenterden),
West Hythe, and Erith (Erehithe&mdash;the
old landing-place for Lesnes Abbey on the
Thames).</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Thyrne</span> = thorn. Our Thornham.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Cisil</span> = gravel. Our Chislehurst (Cyselhurst
in 973), or gravelly wood.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Cnol</span> = hill-top, as in Knowle, Knowle Hill (in
Boughton Malherbe), and Knowlton.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Beyr</span> = shed, cottage. Dr. Sweet makes it the
same as Bur (modern Bower). Hence perhaps
our Burham and Burmarsh; but the old forms
of Burham would point rather to Borow or
Borough&mdash;the walled settlement.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Aesc</span> = ash. Our Ash, Ashenden, Ashford,
Ashley, and Ashurst.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Hlep</span> = leap. Hence Hartlip, of old Hertelepe.
There are two places thus named.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Pirge</span> = pear tree. Possibly Perrywood and
Perry Street. And Perhamstede according to
authorities.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Plum-treu</span> = plum tree. Hence Plumstead&mdash;and
Plumpton?</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Faerh</span> = a young pig, whence our word
&ldquo;farrow.&rdquo; Considering that the rearing of swine
was the chief occupation in the dens, I wonder
that no one has suggested this word for the first
syllable of Farleigh and Fairlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Brycg</span> = bridge. The Saxon had the word, but
not many bridges. Most of our eleven place-names
in Kent containing this word are of post-Saxon
date, while we have fifteen &ldquo;fords.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Sae</span> = sea. So our Seasalter and Seabrook.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Aac</span> = oak. We have Ackholt, Acol, Acryse,
Oakhurst, Oakley, and Ockholt (now Knockholt).</p>
<p><span class="sc">Elm</span>, borrowed from the Latin Ulmus. The
Witch-elm, called Wice in Saxon, is indigenous,
the other elm imported. We have Elmley, Elmstead,
and Elmstone.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Mistel</span> = mistletoe (ta. fem.&mdash;tdig) may
appear in Mistleham, near Appledore.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Caelf</span> = calf. The Saxon name for Challock
was Caelf-loca-n, <i>i.e.</i>, enclosed place for calves.
The second syllable suggests the Latin locus, but
is the source of our English Lock, <i>i.e.</i>, shut up.
So the locks on the river; and pounds for straying
cattle are &ldquo;lokes&rdquo; in East Anglia.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Pleg-huses</span> = theatres (or recreation grounds).
Our Plaistow and Plaxtol.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Syla</span> = wallowing place. So our numerous
Soles, which I later enumerate.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Dimhus</span> and <span class="sc">Dimhof</span> = hiding or dark place.
Our Dymchurch are instances.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Crocc</span> and <span class="sc">Hweras</span> are both Saxon for pots.
Few know what pure Saxon they use when they
talk of crockery-ware. Pottery was always a
great industry from Sittingbourne to Sheppey,
and the Romans appreciated and extended it.
This may account for our Crokham Hill, Crockham,
Crockhurst Street, and Crockshard.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Cocca</span>, gen. plural = chickens. Cock St.,
Cockham Wood, Cockshill, Coxheath, Cockadam
Shaw, while in Detling we have Cock-hill, Upper
and Lower Cox Street. Some may, of course,
be modern and personal names; but I cannot so
trace them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Boley Hill</span>, near Rochester, was undoubtedly
a place of civic importance in very early days. It
was a Danish meeting place corresponding to
our shire-mote at Pennington Heath, and we
may best trace its name to a Danish word which
we still use&mdash;the bole of a tree. This is found in
various parts of the Danish district of Lincolnshire,
and the reference may be to the hill with
a famous tree under which the court of the community
was held. Trees, as well as cromlechs
or great stones, were common landmarks in
Saxon times&mdash;hence our various Stones in Kent.
Others, however, consider it a corruption of
Beaulieu, a name given by the Templars to the
sites of their preceptories, and they instance a
Boley or Bully Mead in East London, which
belonged to the Templars. And others, because
of its ancient legal associations, think it should
be Bailey Hill, and refer us to the Old Bailey in
London.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Farleigh.</span>&mdash;On a clear day from Detling Hill we
can see, not only Farleigh, near Maidstone, but
Fairlight Church, near Hastings. In Saxon days
and documents these place-names were the same,
and so in Domesday (1086), each is Ferlega, the
passage or fareing through the pastures or leys,
just as our modern Throwley is Trulega, with
the scribes&rsquo; variations in 12th century deeds of
Thruleghe, Trulleda, Trulea, Thrulege, and
Trudlege. Fairlight, therefore, is simply a
modern corruption after a fashion which once
corrupted the name of Leigh, near Tonbridge,
which I find written Legh in 1435, Ligth in 1513,
Lyghe in 1525, and Lyght in 1531. It has been
suggested that the first syllable may indicate a
personal name, F&aelig;r; but this seems less tenable.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Borstall</span>, from the Anglo-Saxon Beorg, a
hill, and stal, a dwelling (as in Tunstall), means
a path up a steep hill. So there is Borstall Hill
near Rochester, Bostall Hill near Woolwich, and
Borstall Hill by Whitstable. And I have noted
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
a passage in White&rsquo;s <i>Selborne</i>&mdash;he made a path
up the wooded steep hill near his vicarage called
the Hanger, and he writes: &ldquo;Now the leaf is
down, the Bostall discovers itself in a faint, delicate
line running up the Hanger.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Eastry.</span>&mdash;Lambarde thought this village was
so named to distinguish it from West-Rye, now
called simply Rye, but the places are too far
apart, especially when the great forest of
Anderida came between them. McClure, our
most recent authority on British place-names,
would refer it to the Rugii, a Continental clan
from the Island of Rugen in the Baltic, whom
he finds represented in S&ucirc;thryge (Surrey). So
he would make the word East-ryge, and in a
charter of 780 it is Eastrygena, and in another
Eastryge. But amongst the various early spellings
is Eastereye, <i>i.e.</i>, E&aacute;storegg (No, not Easter
Egg!), the island of E&aacute;stor. In a will of 929,
&ldquo;&AElig;thelnoth, the reeve to Eastorege,&rdquo; is mentioned.
Now the next parish is Woodnesborough,
the town of Woden, the Saxon god. So here
may well be, named at the same time and by the
same people, the name of E&aacute;stor, the goddess of
spring; while, as to its suffix, the centre of the
village stands higher than the rest, and is almost
entirely surrounded by a valley, though not now
by water. Fewer greater authorities than Professor
Skeat are to be found, and he inclines to
this interpretation.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Folkestone.</span>&mdash;Here we find several interpretations,
the more modern being the most absurd.
Thus Phillipott suggests the town full of folk!
and Murray&rsquo;s Handbook to Kent Fulke&rsquo;s Town
(whoever this Fulke may have been)! Both,
however, forgot that the final syllable is always
stane or stone, and not ton. Another imaginative
worthy says that its stone quarries were much
used in the 13th and 14th centuries, and belonged
to the community, and so it was the Folks&rsquo;
Stone! Folcland we know; Folcmote we know;
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
but what is this? The <i>Anglo Saxon Chronicle</i>
says that Harold seized ships at Folcesstane, and
in Domesday it appears as Falchestan. Harris
simply Latinizes the name and calls it Lapis
populi, the stone of the people, and as in Ninnius
(8th cent.) there is a reference in his description
of England to the &ldquo;stone of inscription on the
Gallic sea,&rdquo; which some would identify with
Folkestone; he may be more right than he knew.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Plaxtol</span>, near Sevenoaks.&mdash;In many Kentish
parishes (and elsewhere) the name Pleystole or
Playstool clings to a piece of land on which
miracle and other plays were acted when amusements
had to be mainly home-grown. So at
Lynsted, Herbert Finch, in the sixth year of
Queen Elizabeth, bequeathed the &ldquo;Playstall et
Playstollcroft&rdquo; fields. A variant of the name we
may find in Plaistow, by Bromley. So in Selborne
(Gilbert White&rsquo;s renowned village) the
Plestor is the old playground. Would that in all
villages, especially since the looting of old commons,
there might be a field thus consecrated to
healthy recreation.</p>
<p class="tb">Amongst the sources of enlightenment as to
the meaning of our place-names I have turned to
the volume of the English Dialect Society, which
is on the <i>Kentish Dialect and Provincialisms</i>,
and was prepared by the Revs. W. D. Parish
and W. F. Shaw. It does not contain, as I have
found, nearly all our local words, and not a few
of the words it does give are by any means
peculiar to Kent. Still, it is useful and interesting,
and it may well be that some of our Kent
place-names are almost peculiar to Kent, especially
as the neighbouring counties of Sussex and
Essex were populated by Saxons, but Kent was
populated by the Jutes, and no doubt their
common tongue had its tribal variations. I take
from this dictionary all the words which are
illustrative of place-names.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Forstall</span> = &ldquo;a farm-yard before a house; a
paddock near a farm house; or the farm buildings....
As a local name, Forestalls seem to
have abounded in Kent.&rdquo; Two instances are
given; but I have noted Broken Forestall, Buckley;
Clare&rsquo;s Forestall, Throwley; Mersham
Forstall; Forstall Farm, Egerton; The Forstall,
Hunton; Preston Forstall, Wingham; Painter&rsquo;s
Forestall, Ospringe; Hunter&rsquo;s Forstall, Herne;
Fostal, Herne Hill; Forstall, Lenham; Forstall,
Aylesford; Shepherd&rsquo;s Forstall, Sheldwich&mdash;and
no doubt there are more.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Tye.</span>&mdash;&ldquo;An extensive common pasture, such as
Waldershare Tie and Old Wives&rsquo; Lees Tie, and
in a document of 1510, a croft called Wolves&rsquo;
Tie.&rdquo; I would add the places called Olantigh,
one near Wye and another near Fordwich. Teig-r
is really a Norse word meaning a piece of grassland,
and when borrowed or used by the Saxons
it became Tigar, Tig and Tey in such place-names
as Mark&rsquo;s Tey.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Yokelet.</span>&mdash;&ldquo;An old name in Kent for a little
farm or manor.&rdquo; Cake&rsquo;s Yoke is the name of a
farm in Crundale. The yoke was a measure of
land, probably such as one yoke of oxen could
plough. Thus it corresponds to the Latin jugum,
which means a yoke, and also a land measure.
We have also West Yoke in Ash-next-Ridley;
Yoklet, a borough in Waltham; land so named
in Saltwood; and Ickham was of old Yeckham
or Ioccham, from the A.S. yeok, a yoke of arable
land. Iocclet is also given in the dictionary as
a Kenticism for a small farm.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Bodge.</span>&mdash;&ldquo;A measure of corn, about a bushel.&rdquo;
May this suggest a derivation for Bodgebury,
some land with a cottage thereon, part of the old
glebe of Detling?</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Brent.</span>&mdash;&ldquo;The Middle-English word Brent
most commonly meant burnt; but there was
another Brent, an adjective which signified
steep.&rdquo; Thus Brentwood in Essex is the same
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
as Burnt Wood in Detling, but the Brents or
North Preston near Faversham, and the Brent
Gate therein refer to the steep contour of the
land. A Celtic root, found in Welsh as bryn, a
ridge, accounts for many such names as Brendon
Hill, Birwood Forest, Brandon, a ridge in Essex,
Breandown near Weston-super-Mare, and many
Swiss and German names for steep places.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Court</span>, or Court Lodge.&mdash;&ldquo;The manor house,
where the court leet of the manor is held.&rdquo; So
in Detling we have East Court and West Court
because, in default of a son, the old manor was
divided between two co-heiresses in the 16th
century. So we have as place-names North
Court in Eastling, a Court at Street in Lympne,
besides very many names of old houses, such as
Eastry Court, Selling Court, etc.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Down.</span>&mdash;&ldquo;A piece of high open ground, not
peculiar to Kent, but perhaps more used here
than elsewhere. Thus we have Updown in
Eastry, Hartsdown and Northdown in Thanet,
Leysdown in Sheppey, and Barham Downs.&rdquo; I
may add Puttock&rsquo;s Down (the Kite&rsquo;s Down),
three villages called Kingsdown, Derry Downs,
Downe, Hackemdown, Harble Down, Housedown,
Kilndown, two Underdowns, besides probably
some of the names ending in don. The
Celtic dun, a hill-fortress, found all over Europe,
is directly found in our Croydon, as in London,
Dunstable, etc., and the Saxon extended its use,
especially in the plural, to high ground, whether
crowned with a fort or camp or not. Trevisa
wrote in 1398 &ldquo;A downe is a lytel swellynge or
aresynge (arising) of erthe passynge the playne
ground ... and not retchyng to hyghnesse of
an hylle.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Fright</span> or Frith.&mdash;&ldquo;A thin, scrubby wood.&rdquo;
So the Fright Woods near Bedgebury. And I
learned to skate as a boy at the Fright Farm on
Dover Castle Hill. This may account for Frith
by Newnham, and possibly also for Frittenden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Polder.</span>&mdash;&ldquo;A marsh: a piece of boggy soil.&rdquo;
A place in Eastry now called Felder land was of
old Polder land, and nearer Sandwich is a place
still called Polders. Poll (Celtic), Pool (Early
English), Proll (Welsh), is a common prefix to
the name of a brook. Polhill, however, in Harrietsham,
is more likely to come from the great
Kent family of the Polhills. So we have Polhill
Farm in Detling, and a Polhill was Vicar in
1779.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Rough.</span>&mdash;&ldquo;A small wood; any rough, woody
place.&rdquo; So Bushy Rough in the Alkham Valley,
where rises one of the sources of the river Dour.
Hence also Rough Hills in Hernhill; Rough
Common near Canterbury; and perhaps Roughway
in Plaxtol, the wood being used in the
Kentish rather than the usual sense.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Saltings</span>, or Salterns, or Salts.&mdash;&ldquo;Salt
marshes on the sea-side of the sea-walls.&rdquo; A
North Kent word, naming Saltbox, and Salterns,
both in Sheppey, and probably Seasalter near
Whitstable. We must find, however, if we can,
another derivation for Saltwood Castle.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Selynge.</span>&mdash;Toll, custom, tribute. The Prior
of Christ Church, Canterbury, used to take in
the Stoure a certain custom, which was called
Selynge, of every little boat which came to an
anchor before the mouth of the said Flete. The
compilers of the Dictionary say: &ldquo;The parish of
Sellindge, near Hythe, probably takes its name
from some such ancient payment.&rdquo; Is it possible
that the old name of Sentlynge, given to S.
Mary&rsquo;s Cray in Domesday Book, may point to
another place of tolling craft on the Cray?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><span class="sc">The Northmen in Kent.</span></span></h2>
<p>A <i>Furore Normanorum</i> was a petition
in an old litany in England before it
had gained that name. And with reason,
for the success of Angles, Jutes and Saxons in
the conquest of England drew the attention of
Scandinavian and other Vikings, who found that
booty could be gained by rapid raids. It was at
the end of the eighth century that the Danes (as
they came to be called, although the wider
&ldquo;Northmen&rdquo; would be a better term), reached
the land of the Angles, coming from Norway to
Dorset, and generally harrying the eastern and
southern coasts for a couple of hundred years.
They also remained and settled, mainly to the
north of the Humber, until at last the greater
part of England came under their power, and
in 1016 Cnut became the Danish King of England.</p>
<p>Our forefathers in Kent should have our sympathy
for the continuous state of alarm in which
they were kept. In 832 Scandinavian pirates
ravaged Sheppey. In 838 they won a battle in
Merscware (<i>i.e.</i>, the land of the Marsh-folk, <i>i.e.</i>,
Romney Marsh), and slew many in Canterbury.
In 851 nine of their piratical ships were taken in
battle at Londovic (Sandwich) by &AElig;thelstan, the
under-king of Kent; but they remained to winter
in Thanet for the first time, and in the same year
350 of their ships entered the Thames and took
both Cantwaraburg and Lundenburg (London).
In 853 the men of Kent, under the Alderman
Ealchere, with the men of Surrey, fought in
Tenet (Thanet), but were worsted. Next year
they wintered in Sceap-ige (Sheppey). In 865 the
men of Kent tried to buy off the heathen invaders,
who, however, ravaged all East Kent.</p>
<p>Then arose the great man, Alfred, who in 871
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
had eight battles with the Danes south of the
Thames. In 885 they besieged Hrofceastre
(Rochester), but King Alfred relieved it, and
the Danes took to their ships, having lost all
their horses. In 893 two hundred and fifty
Danish ships came to Limenemouth (Lympne),
took their fleet four miles up the river, and made
a strong fort at Apuldore, while Hasting with
80 ships entered the Thames estuary, made a
fort at Milton, and later one at Sceobyrig (Shoebury).
In 969 Eadger orders Tenet land to be
pillaged, and in 980 Thanet is overrun by the
Danes. In 986 the bishopric of Hrofceastre was
devastated. In 993 a fleet of nearly four hundred
ships came to &ldquo;Stone,&rdquo; which may be the one in
the Isle of Oxney, or another near Faversham
on the Watling Street, or another on the Swale,
and went on to Sandwic, which was their chief
southern haven, and embodies in its name the
Scandinavian wic or bay (Sandwic is a common
place-name in Iceland and Norway).</p>
<p>In 994 Anlaf, King of Norway, and Sweyn,
King of Denmark, with a fleet of nearly 500,
failed to take London, but ravaged Kent and
other counties. In 998 they sailed up the Medway
estuary to Rochester, and there beat the
Kentish army. In 1005 a fleet came to Sandwic
and despoiled the country.</p>
<p>In 1007 England despaired, and paid a tribute
of &pound;36,000, while Thurkell&rsquo;s army came to Sandwich
and thence to Canterbury, where the people
of East Kent bought peace at the cost of &pound;3,000,
while the Danes spent the winter in repairing
their ships. In 1012 they took Canterbury and
martyred the Archbishop &AElig;lfheah, better known
to us as S. Alphege. In 1013 Sweyn came again
to Sandwich; but in 1014 Eadmund (Edmund
Etheling) attacked the Danes in Kent, drove
them into Sheppey, and met their leader in battle
at &AElig;glesforda (Avlesford). But in 1016 Cnut
(Canute) became King of all England, and to
him in 1018 &pound;72,000 was paid in tribute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>In 1203 the body of S. Alphege was allowed
by Cnut to be taken to Canterbury, and England
remained a Danish province. In 1040 Harda-Cnut
was brought from Bruges to succeed
Harold as King, and landed at Sandwich. In
1046 Thanet was ravaged again by the Northmen;
but in 1049 King Edward gathered a great
fleet at Sandwich against Sweyn, and later this
fleet lay at D&aelig;rentamutha (<i>i.e.</i>, Darentmouth,
<i>i.e.</i> Dartford). In 1051 King Edward&rsquo;s brother-in-law,
Eustace, lost some followers in a fracas
at Dofra (Dover).</p>
<p>But a great change was imminent, and England
was to change one domination for another,
and in 1052 Wilhelm (afterwards the Conqueror)
visited King Edward the Confessor (or Saint)
with a great host of Normans, and he exiled
Earl Godwin, who came from Bruges to N&oelig;sse
(Dungeness) was driven back. Returning with
his son Harold to Dungeness, they took all the
ships they could find at Rumenea (Romney),
Heda (Hythe), and Folcesstane. Thence to
Dofra and Sandwich, ending up with ravaging
Sheppey and Middeltun (Milton, near Sittingbourne).
Then, in 1066, Harold dies in battle at
Hastings, and William begins our Norman
dynasty, Northmen being succeeded by
Normans.</p>
<p>Traces of the visits to Kent are found in
various place-names, though more common in
other parts of Britain, and indeed in other
countries, since as marauders, colonists, or conquerors
they were for three centuries the terror
of Europe, from Iceland to Italy. The many
places with the suffixes byr or by, thorpe, throp,
or trop, toft, thwaite, ville in Normandy, or well
and will in England, garth, beck, haugh, with,
tarn, dale, force, fell, are all almost exclusively
northern to Kent and mainly Norwegian. As to
&ldquo;by&rdquo; for town, there are 600 north of the
Thames and east of Watling Street, and hardly
any in the south. The one apparent exception in
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
Kent&mdash;Horton Kirkby&mdash;is no exception, for it
was simply Horton until the time of Edward the
First, when Roger de Kirkby, <i>from Lancashire</i>,
married a Kentish heiress and the manor and
place were re-named after him.</p>
<p>We have, however, certain records of their
piratical visits, as at Deptford and Fordwich,
where the termination is not the Anglo-Saxon
ford, meaning a passage across a river, but the
Norse fiord, a roadstead for ships. Deptford is the
deep fiord, where ships could anchor close to
the bank, and Fordwich, the smallest &ldquo;limb&rdquo; of
the Cinque Ports, was once the port of Canterbury
on the Stour, and gives us wic, the Norse
for station for ships, a small creek or bay. So,
in Kent, we have also from the same source
Wick in Romney Marsh, Greenwich, Woolwich,
and Sandwich. Inland, however, Wich or Wick,
is an Anglo-Saxon borrowing from the Latin
vicus, and means houses or a village.</p>
<p>Another Norse word in Kent is Ness or Naze,
a nose or promontory, such as Dungeness, Shoeburyness,
Pepperness, Foulness, Shellness,
Sheerness, Sharpness Cliff at Dover, whence
criminals were hurled, Whiteness, Foreness,
Bartlett Ness and Oakham Ness. The Nore, in
Kent, is the Norse, or perhaps Jutish, N&ocirc;r, a
bay with a narrow entrance, and the word is
unique in Britain, unless we may find it also in
Normarsh, near Rainham. Again attributable to
our invaders, and again purely coastal, are the
places ending in <i>fliot</i>, a small river or creek, such
as Northfleet, Southfleet, Ebbsfleet, with Purfleet
on the opposite bank of the Thames. Thanet
and Sheppey were for us their chief points of
attack and their naval stations, while the Danelagh
or Kingdom whence the Norse element predominated
had the Wash as the chief entrance
whence they radiated out.</p>
<p>The suffix &ldquo;gate&rdquo; may be either from the
Saxon geat or the Scandinavian gata, but when
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
we find Ramsgate, Dargate, Margate, Westgate,
Kingsgate, Snargate, and Sandgate, all
on the coast, while in Romney Marsh &ldquo;gut&rdquo;
takes the place of &ldquo;gate,&rdquo; as in Jervis Kut,
Clobesden Gut, and Denge Marsh Gut, we may
incline to a Scandinavian origin.</p>
<p>It is in the north, and the north only according
to the best authorities, that the suffix ing represents
the Norse <i>eng</i> for grass-land.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><span class="sc">The Islands of Kent.</span></span></h2>
<p>Most islands are attached portions of the
nearest mainland, severed in prehistoric
times by subsidence of the intervening
soil and the action of strong currents. Thus
even England is a portion of the Continent, as
its fauna and flora proclaim, while Ireland was
severed earlier still. Thus also the Isle of Wight
is Hampshire. So our Kentish islands, now only
two and neither now to be effectually circumnavigated,
are practically absorbed in the mainland.
&ldquo;Sheppey, Thanet&mdash;what else?&rdquo; most
would say. Yet the early geographer Nennius,
writing in the eighth century, has the following
quaint passage:&mdash;&ldquo;The first marvel is the Lommon
Marsh&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, Limen, now Romney), &ldquo;for
in it are 340 islands with men and women living
on them. It is girt by 340 rocks, and in every
rock is an eagle&rsquo;s nest, and 340 rivers run into
it, and there goes out of it into the sea but one
river, which is called the Lemn.&rdquo; Truly a picturesque
account of the numerous spots, where
dry land first appeared in the shallow bay, and
the countless sluices which intersected them.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Romney</span>&rdquo; is probably formed by the addition
of the Saxon Ige, By, or Ea&mdash;island, to the
earlier Celtic Ruim&mdash;marsh, and so gives an
idea of what the district was before the Romans
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
reclaimed much by building their great Rhee
Wall. Certain names in Romney Marsh preserved
the same history. <span class="sc">Oxeney</span> (still we have
the Island and the Hundred of Oxney, containing
Wittersham and Stone parishes) is even now
insulated by two branches of the Rother, and
here, in the ancient and now diverted channel,
was found in 1824 an oaken ship buried deep in
sand and mud. Its name is said to mean the isle
of the fat beeves. On pagan altars discovered
there oxen were carved, and still it is a great
cattle-raising district. We should look now in
vain for the three ferries by which it was
once entered. In its centre is <span class="sc">Ebony</span>, no doubt
originally a sort of island, once called &ldquo;Ebeney
in Oxney,&rdquo; and in an early document it appears
as Hibbene. It has been suggested that the first
part of the word is the old Celtic Avon, <i>i.e.</i>,
water or river, and I find that a Saxon charter
of 793 A.D. calls the Gloucester Avon by the
name of Aben. The third syllable is, of course,
the Saxon word for island. Scotney Court, Lydd,
and Scotney Castle, Lamberhurst, no doubt
preserve the name of the Barons de Scotini, who
came from Scotigny in North France, and possessed,
in the 12th century, much land, which
they held until the reign of Edward the Third,
while Scot&rsquo;s Hall, near Smeeth, was the seat of
Knights of that name down to the time of the
Armada. But for this history one might have
classed Scotney with Oxney and Ebony.</p>
<p class="tb">Coming now to <span class="sc">Sheppey</span>, still an island,
washed on the north by the estuary of the
Thames, on the west by that of the Medway, and
insulated by the Swale (Saxon Suala), crossed
by a railway bridge and two ferries, the Celtic
name is said to have been Malata, from Mohlt,
a sheep, which the Saxon conquerors translated
into Sceap-ige, Sheep Isle. It includes <span class="sc">Elmley</span>
and <span class="sc">Harty</span>, once its little islands, and now
peninsulas. An old name for Harty was Hertai,
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
in which we may perhaps find the Saxon Heorat&mdash;stag,
hart&mdash;as in Hartlip and Hartbourne, and
ea&mdash;island. And Elmley, which island would
simply denote the ley or glade in the forest in
which elms were frequent, might here be Elm-isle.
And another islet was <span class="sc">Graven-ea</span>, the grain
island, on the opposite side of the Swale, now in
the Faversham marshes.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Thanet</span>, the best known and most important
island, was in the 5th century separated from the
mainland by the Wantsum and the estuary of the
Stour, which gave an expanse of water mainly
two miles broad, so that vessels from or to London
sailed from Reculver to Richborough, and
avoided the longer and rougher route round the
North Foreland. To guard this sea-way the
Romans had placed their forts of Regulbium
(Reculver) and Rutupia (Richborough) at its
northern and eastern entrance. Now, and for
long, by the dwindling of the Stour and the practical
extinction of the Wantsum, Thanet is but
in name an island. Even writing in 1570, Lambarde
calls it a peninsula. It is said that its
Celtic name was Rimn&mdash;a headland, and that
its later Saxon name, Tenet, means a beacon.
Solinus, who wrote about A.D. 80, calls it Ad-Tanatos
(Thanatos, Greek for Death, because its
soil killed snakes even when exported for that
purpose!). Nennius, in the 8th century, says
Guorthigern handed to Hengist and Horsa the
island, &ldquo;which in their language is called Tenet,
but in British speech Ruoihm,&rdquo; or Ru-oichim.
In a charter of 679 it appears as Tenid. The
name, says McClure, may involve the Celtic
Tann for oaks, as in Glastenec, an early form of
Glastonbury, surviving in the English, Tanner,
Tanyard, etc. From this root is derived the
Breton place-name Tannouet. Tenid is its oldest
Saxon form, and the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i> records
that in 969 Eadgar ordered Tenetland to be
pillaged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Variations in the Spelling of Place-Names.</span></span></h2>
<p>In the search for the meaning of a place-name
it is necessary to go back as far as possible
and discover, if we can, its earliest form.
The <i>Anglo Saxon Chronicle</i>, and the later
Domesday Book of 1086; the gradual blending
of Saxon and Norman into the English tongue;
and then the invention of printing; all may have
had an effect on the pronunciation, and so the
spelling, of a word. Also there is the tendency
to shorten a long word, as when Pepingeberia
becomes Pembury, or Godwinston, through
Gusseton, becomes Guston. And before the
standardization of spelling which printing to a
great extent effected, and in written documents
such as charters or wills, the most remarkable
variations will occur according to personal varieties
of pronunciation. Even now, though every
one reads &ldquo;I am going,&rdquo; in one county you may
hear &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a gowin&rsquo;,&rdquo; in another &ldquo;I be gooin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
in another &ldquo;I be gwaine,&rdquo; and so forth, and so
one wonders less at the various forms in which
a name appears in writing in Saxon, in Norman,
or in Early English days.</p>
<p>As a general rule the earliest form will be
best and most likely to indicate why a name was
given. To illustrate this source, both of information
and of error, let me take two Kentish
place-names&mdash;Westenhanger and Tenterden&mdash;giving
the dates at which I find the various
forms.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Westenhanger.</span>&mdash;There is a Teutonic stem
hanh which means to hang, with the Anglo-Saxon
later forms, H&ocirc;n, H&ecirc;ng, from which we
get our place names of hanger, Ongar, etc. A
hanger is a wood or copse hanging on the side
of a hill, and in Kent we find Betteshanger,
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
Hangherst, and Ackhanger, as well as Westenhanger,
concerning which Leland in his Itinerary
writes of &ldquo;Ostinhaungre ... of sum now corruptly
called Westenanger.&rdquo; I find it spelled
Ostrynghangre in 1274 and 1291, Westynghangre
in 1343, Westingangre in 1346, Ostrynhangre
in 1376 and 1381, Estynghangre in 1383,
Westynganger in 1385, Ostynhangre in 1409,
Ostrynghanger in 1468, Westinganger in 1472,
Ostrynhanger in 1478, Westynghanger in 1511,
Westhanger in 1519, and Oystenhanger in 1541.
The changes of the first syllable illustrate the
continuance of the Saxon W&oelig;st and the Norman
Ouest until there is the reversion to the Saxon
form in our West.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Tenterden</span>, again, has a long list of variants.
Probably its Saxon name indicated the place
where the Theinwarden, or Thane&rsquo;s Warden or
Guardian, looked after the rights and dues of
various other dens where his swine had pannage
and his tenants tended them. It is not mentioned
in Domesday, as not of sufficient importance or
taxability; but in 1190 I find it as Tentwarden,
in 1252 as Thendwardenne and Tentwardenn, in
1255 as Tentwardene&mdash;this early and probably
original form cropping up at intervals for another
three hundred years. But in 1259 we get nearer
to the extant form, as Tendyrdenn. In 1300
there is Tenterdenne, and in 1311 Tentredenne.
From this point I take the spellings from the
Archbishop&rsquo;s register of the institutions of its
parish priests, and here the earliest record is
Tenterdenne in 1311. Thenceforward Tent&rsquo;denne
and Tant&rsquo;denn in 1322, Tentrdenn in 1327, Tenterdenne
in 1333, Tentwardene in 1342, Tenterdenne
in 1346, Tentwardyn in 1390, Tynterden
in 1394, Tent&rsquo;den in 1404, Tenterden (for the
first time exactly in its present form) in 1407,
Tendirden in 1436, Tentwarden at various dates
from 1464 to 1531, Tentreden in 1501 and 1525,
Tenterden in 1511, 1523, 1539, and 1546, &ldquo;Tentwarden
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
alias Tenterden&rdquo; in 1541, Tynterden in
1546, Tenterden in 1556, Tentwarden in 1560,
Tenterden in 1571 and 1615, Tentarden in 1619,
Tendarden in 1626, Tentarden in 1627 and 1636.
Henceforth it is always Tenterden in the Lambeth
Registers. These variations are the more
noticeable as all occurring in one office, where one
would have expected a settled and continuously
adopted form, whereas in such documents as
wills the testator, or even the scrivener who
wrote the will, would have only the current or
the personal idea as to the right spelling of a
name.</p>
<p class="tb">Elsewhere I have given variations of the places
we now know as Edenbridge, Cuxton, Shepherdswell,
Bethersden, Eastry, Throwley, etc. One
might add the cases of Freondesbyry (Saxon),
Frandesberie (Domesday), Frenesbery, and
Frendesbury, for our <span class="sc">Frindsbury</span>; of Estbarbrenge,
Barmyage, Barmling, Barmelinge, and
Berblinge, for our <span class="sc">Barming</span>; &AElig;pledure (Saxon),
Apeldres (Domesday), Apoldre (1381), Apeltre,
Appledrau, and Appuldre, for our <span class="sc">Appledore</span>;
of P&oelig;dlewrtha (Saxon), Pellesorde (Domesday),
and Pallesford, for our three <span class="sc">Paddlesworths</span>;
Hertlepeshille (temp. Edw. II.), Herclepe, Hertelepe,
and Harclypp (1534), for our <span class="sc">Hartlip</span>; and
Ok&rsquo;olte (<i>i.e.</i>, Oak Wood), Ocholte, Sud-Acholt,
Scottesocholt, and Nokeholde, for our <span class="sc">Knockholt</span>.
The etymological advantage of going
back is seen in the case of <span class="sc">Ringwould</span>, which
becomes more intelligible when down to the time
of Henry 3rd it was known as Ridelinwalde or
Rydelynewelde (<i>i.e.</i>, the settlement of the clan
of Ryddeling by the wood), whereas not till 1476
do I find Ringeweld, and Ringewold in 1502.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Ecclesiastical Place-Names.</span></span></h2>
<p>There are not so many as one would expect
considering the importance and power and
the possessions of the Church in Kent.
Taking some as they occur to me, there are <span class="sc">All
Hallows</span>, in Sheppey, so named from the dedication
of its church to All Saints&rsquo;. The Latin
Sanctus and the Teutonic Helige are the same in
meaning. So we have, too, in Lower Halstow
the Saxon helige stow&mdash;the holy place. In a list
of Jack Cade&rsquo;s Kentish followers, in 1450, the
parish of Omi Scor is mentioned, which puzzled
me for a moment until I saw it was a contraction
for Omnium Sanctorum, All Saints&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="tb">The two <span class="sc">Minsters</span>, one in Thanet and one in
Sheppey, both of Saxon foundation, are the
Latin Monasterium, found later as Moynstre and
then as Menstre. <span class="sc">Monkton</span>, earlier Moncstun
and Monkynton, marks a manor given A.D. 961
by Queen Eadgiva to the monks of the community
of Holy Trinity, which afterwards became
the greater Christ Church, Canterbury. There
are also, for the same reasons, Monks Horton
and Monks Hill, by Herne Hill, in Blean.
<span class="sc">Bishopsbourne</span>, earlier Bishopstone, and
Bishopsdenne, denotes an episcopal manor. The
old nucleus of <span class="sc">Lydd</span> was Bishopswic, and in
Domesday <span class="sc">Boughton Malherbe</span> appears as Boltone
Archiepiscopi. <span class="sc">Preston</span>, near Wingham
(there is another by Aylesford, and a third near
Faversham) is Priest&rsquo;s Town, and denotes a
place where there was a small college of clergy.
That near Wingham is recorded in Domesday as
Prestetune, and in a fine of Edward II. we have:
&ldquo;Preston next Wengham and Wykham
Brewouse.&rdquo; It belonged to S. Augustine&rsquo;s
Abbey at Canterbury. <span class="sc">S. Nicholas at Wade</span>
is named from the dedication of the ancient
church. At Wade represents the Latin Ad
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
Vadum, at the ford, over the Wantsum, into
Thanet, near the existing-bridge at Sarre.</p>
<p class="tb">S. Margaret&rsquo;s Bay and <span class="sc">S. Margaret&rsquo;s at
Cliffe</span> retain their Norman dedications. The
church originally belonged to S. Martin&rsquo;s Priory
at Dover. <span class="sc">Lillechurch</span> House, near Higham,
marks the site of the old Priory of Higham. The
Hundred of Lesnes (A.S. leswes, pastures) is the
district once attached to the Augustinian Abbey
(whence the present name of <span class="sc">Abbey Wood</span>)
founded in 1178 by the Chief Justice and Regent
Richard de Lucy.</p>
<p class="tb">Of the five parishes named from the river Cray
two are named from the patron saints of their
churches. <span class="sc">S. Mary Cray</span> is, however, called
Sentlynge in Domesday Book. <span class="sc">S. Paul&rsquo;s Cray</span>
is a misnomer, since the dedication is to S.
Paulinus, Bishop of Rochester, and afterwards
Archbishop of York. So in a deed of 1291 I find
it as Creypaulin, and in a fine of Edward II.,
1314, as Paulynescraye. In 1560, however, it
appears as Powle&rsquo;s Crey.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Brenzett</span>, in Romney Marsh, does not suggest
in its present form either a Celtic or a Saxon
origin; but as its old church was dedicated to S.
Eanswith, a popular Saxon Saint, also commemorated
in the S. Mary and S. Eanswith of
the original church at Folkestone, it has been
suggested that Brenzett has been evolved in process
of time out of Eanswith. Bresett and Brynsete
(1416) are variants of the place-name. There
is also the parish of <span class="sc">S. Mary in the Marsh</span>
hard by. <span class="sc">Newchurch</span>, also in the Marsh, is
Neucerce in Domesday (1036), but as there is no
Norman work in the church, which is of Early
English architecture, it is supposed that shortly
before Domesday an older church had been pulled
down. Then and still it gives its name to the
Hundred of Newchurch in the Lathe of Limea
or Limowart, which was re-named Shepway in
the time of Henry the Third. Also in the Marsh
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
is <span class="sc">Dymchurch</span>, earlier Demchurche. But earlier
still it is said to have been called simply Dimhus
or Dimhof, which would mean in Saxon the
dark or hiding place; so that &ldquo;church&rdquo; may be
a later addition to an old name. <span class="sc">Eastchurch</span>,
in Sheppey, was, and is, the easternmost church
in the island.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Place-Names from Persons.</span></span></h2>
<p>We have seen how common in Kent are
place-names derived from patronymics of
the name of a family or clan, such as
Kennington, the settlement of the Cennings, but
there are others, mainly more modern, which
include the name of an individual, who usually
would be the lord of the manor. Thus some have
imagined that <span class="sc">Swingfield</span>, near Dover, is
Sweyn&rsquo;s Field, as if the Saxons would have
named a place after their piratical enemy. The
older forms, Swonesfelde and Swynefelde, would
more naturally point to swine, the keeping of
which was the chief pastoral pursuit of the
Saxons in the dens and clearings of the forest.
<span class="sc">Queenborough</span>, or Quinborowe, however (earlier
known as Bynnee), was named by Edward the
Third (who built a strong fort there) in honour
of Queen Philippa in 1368. <span class="sc">Rosherville</span> is
very recent, being named after Jeremiah Rosher,
lord of the manor in the nineteenth century.
<span class="sc">Sutton Valence</span> was Town Sutton until 1265,
when it became part of the possessions of William
de Valence, half-brother of Henry the
Third.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Boughton Aluph</span>&mdash;Bocton Anulphi in a charter
of Edward the Second&mdash;was the seat in the
time of Henry the Seventh of the family of
Aloff, to which Wye belonged. <span class="sc">Boughton
Monchelsea</span> (Bocton Chanesy in the time of
Edward the Second) owes its additional name to
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
a Norman noble; and <span class="sc">Boughton Malherbe</span>
(another Bush-ton, or town in the woods) was
given as a manor to the Norman family of Malherbe.
<span class="sc">Bethersden</span> can be traced back to
Norman times as Beatrichesdenne, probably as
held by an heiress of that name. So <span class="sc">Patrixbourne</span>
appears earliest as Bourne until a Patrick
held the manor. <span class="sc">Capel le Ferne</span>, near Dover,
was originally Mauregge; but in 1175 the Capel
family owned Capel&rsquo;s Court in Ivychurch, and
had estates in several parts of Kent. In the
fifteenth century it was called sometimes S.
Mary Marige and sometimes Capelle le farne,
and in a deed of 1511 it appears as &ldquo;Capelferne
or S. Mary Merge.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Shepherdswell</span>, near Dover, has nothing to
do with a shepherd or a well; but is an early
corruption of Sibertswalt, as it appears in
Domesday, <i>i.e.</i>, the wood of Sibert. The phonetic
changes are found in later charters and wills,
Sybersysweld in 1474, Sybberdiswold 1484, Shipriswold
1501, Shepswold 1506, and Sheperterswold
in 1522. Suabert, or Sieberht, was a great
Saxon thane, and granted land in Sturgeth
(Sturry) and Bodesham to St. Domneva&rsquo;s new
Minster in Thanet, while in a charter of 814 we
read of Selebertineg-lond. Great Chart was
originally Selebert&rsquo;s Chart. Sibbertston (or
Selebertston) was a sub-manor in Chilham, and
there is still the Hundred of Sebrittenden or
Selebertsden in what was the old Lathe of Wye.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Mongeham</span> is probably Monyn&rsquo;s Home, for the
Monins family have been there or near there
since the time of Henry the Third, and are there
still. <span class="sc">Goodneston</span>, commonly called Guston, was
no doubt Godwinston, as in the territory of the
great Earl Godwin, and we trace its present
name through the earlier forms Gounceston,
Goceston, Gusseton, to Guston. Another Goodnestone,
near Faversham, appears as Gudewynston
in 1469 and Goodwinston in 1529. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
Breux, of <span class="sc">Wickham Breux</span>, is another Norman
addition to a Saxon name.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Ebbsfleet</span>, the so important landing place,
first of Hengist and then of S. Augustine, has,
of course, been explained by ignorant guessers
as the place where the sea ebbs! But its earliest
name to be traced is Ypwine&rsquo;s fliot, <i>i.e.</i>, the creek
where some Jute of that name settled. Yp is
probably the Eop in Eoppa, which is a common
Saxon name, also found as Eobba, so that
Eobbe&rsquo;s fleet easily becomes Ebbsfleet. <span class="sc">Upper
Hardres</span> may take us to the Norman family
which came from Ardres in Picardy, although
it is possible to find a common Celtic origin for
the name both of the French and the English
village in the Celtic Ardd, that is, ploughland. It
is Heg Hardres, <i>i.e.</i>, High Hardies, in early
documents.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Horton Kirby</span> was simply Horton until the
reign of Edward III., when a Lancashire Kirby
married the heiress of the manor and rebuilt the
castle. Even in 1377 I find it still called Hortune
only. <span class="sc">Offham</span> is Offa&rsquo;s home, and several places,
including probably <span class="sc">Otham</span>, bear his name. Here
this Christian King of Mercia is said to have
conquered Edmund of Kent. So Old Romney
was earlier Offeton, Effeton, or Affeton. Offa
ruled Sussex and Kent, and so we have Offham
near Lewes, Offington near Worthing, Offham
near Arundel, and Ufton near Tunstall. But the
name of Offeton for Old Romney disappears after
1281. <span class="sc">Foot&rsquo;s Cray</span>, and Footbury Hill near
there, is named from Godwin Fot the Saxon.
<span class="sc">Chelsfield</span> is said to record the name of a
Saxon Ceol, a shortened form of Ceolmund, or
Ceolbald, or Ceolwulf, all of which were common
names. <span class="sc">Scotney Castle</span>, Lamberhurst, belonged
in the 12th century to the Barons de Scoterni,
who came from Pontigny, in N. France. They
had also Scotney Court, at Lydd.</p>
<p class="tb">One may add to these samples of places named
from persons, two or three that very probably
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
take us back to mythical personages. <span class="sc">Woodnesborough</span>
(Wodenesbergh 1465, Wynsbergh
1496), was named by the Jutish conquerors after
their god Woden, whom they commemorated
among the Teutonic names they bequeathed to
our names of the week. There is another Woodnesborough
in Wilts, and Wednesbury and Wednesfield
in Staffordshire. And we note that the
next parish is <span class="sc">Eastry</span>. For the name of this
very old and important place in Saxon time
various derivations have been proposed, but it is
more than possible that it is the town of E&aacute;stor
or Eostre, the goddess of Spring, whose name
survived when the conversion of the heathen
Saxons gave a new light to the festival in the
Spring, which henceforth was to celebrate a
greater Resurrection than that merely of the
flowers. And possibly a third instance may be
found in the name of <span class="sc">Aylesford</span>, which is
Egelesford in the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i>, and Elesford
in Domesday. Amongst various possible derivations
that of Eigil, the Teutonic hero-archer or
demigod, is worthy of consideration, since it is
found as naming places elsewhere; for example,
Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, which in the
<i>Saxon Chronicle</i> appears as &AElig;gelesburh.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Absurdities in Derivation.</span></span></h2>
<p>When a language is not pure, but the result
of the intermingling and interaction of
several tongues as distinct as Celtic,
Saxon and Norman; and when, by the wear and
tear of daily use through centuries, place-names
have altered in detail of spelling and pronunciation;
and when for a long time spelling and reading
were arts known but to a small minority of
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
the population, it is plainly inevitable that the
original form and real meaning of a place-name
should often be difficult to trace. But always
in an enquiring mind there was the insistent
WHY? which is a characteristic and a glory of
man as a reasoning animal, and hence often a
meaning was given to a word that is simply a
sort of pun, an endeavour to explain a word by
what it looks like in current speech or dialect
when there was not the knowledge of earlier
times and older tongues which elevates mere
guessing into the science of etymology.</p>
<p>Some Kentish examples of this source of error
may be useful. Thus, when we trace <span class="sc">Maidstone</span>
back into the earliest records we find that it has
nothing to do with either Maid or Stone, but
comes through many variations from the Celto-Saxon
Medwegston, or town on the Medway.
Yet though Lambard knew and quoted this in
1570 he suggested also a meaning of &ldquo;mighty
stone, a name given for the quarry of hard stone
there!&rdquo; So, too, Hasted thinks <span class="sc">Loose</span> is so
called because the stream loses itself underground
(like the Mole in Surrey) for some eight
hundred yards at Brishing! He might as well
have ascribed the name to Loose and Detling
having been long only Chapelries of Maidstone,
but at last having been cut loose and made into
separate parishes in Elizabethan times!</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tenterden</span> is named, says an old Kentish
writer, as &ldquo;some vulgar fancies conjecture, from
the tenderness of its soil&rdquo;; <span class="sc">Feversham</span>, says
another old Kentish writer, Phillipott, useful as
an historian, useless to etymologists, &ldquo;is an unhealthy
town, and carries the tokens of it in its
name.&rdquo; <i>Id. est.</i>, the home of fevers! <span class="sc">Harbledown</span>,
says Black, is so-called &ldquo;in allusion to its
grassy downs and hills,&rdquo; as if grassiness were
not a characteristic of any and every down and
hill in Kent. <span class="sc">Gadshill</span>, we are solemnly told, is
named from &ldquo;gads,&rdquo; clubs used by footpads who
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
were not unknown there (or anywhere else) on
Watling Street. We should smile less if the
name was Padshill.</p>
<p>And one of the most ancient, and indeed prehistoric,
names in Kent is Penypot, a hill opposite
Chilham. &ldquo;Here once,&rdquo; one old rustic would
say, &ldquo;they dug up a pot full of pennies.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; another would respond, &ldquo;it was where
they used to sell ale for a penny a pot in the
good old days!&rdquo; To such vile meanings may
descend the venerable Celtic Pen y wlh&mdash;the
Head of the Mound.</p>
<p>One of the earliest Roman geographers heard
of Thanet under its earliest name of Tanet, and
because he knew a Greek word Thanatos, which
means death, he so interpreted Thanet. On
this absurdity he based a baseless legend which
Lambarde in 1570 thus describes: &ldquo;There be no
snakes in Tanet (saith he), and the earth that is
brought from thence will kill them.&rdquo; (Why
death to snakes any more than to sheep or
shepherds? Why not go further and make
Thanatos a lifeless place like the Dead Sea?) &ldquo;But
whether he wrote this of any sure understanding
that he had of the quality of the soil, or only by
conjecture at the woord Thanatos, which in
Greeke signifieth death, I wote not.&rdquo; This is
as strong an example of conjectural derivation,
with nothing but a superficial resemblance to
support it, as we could find. But Lambarde himself,
great as he is in many ways, gives derivations
almost as baseless, <i>e.g.</i>, Blackheath,
&ldquo;called of the colour of the soil!&rdquo; Wrotham,
&ldquo;given for the great plentie of woorts or good
hearbs that growe there.&rdquo; Farley, &ldquo;interpreted
the place of the Boares, or Bulles&rdquo; (which? and
why?). Sittingbourne, &ldquo;one interprets it
Seethingbourne, Rivus Fervens aut Hulliens&rdquo;
(<i>i.e.</i>, the boiling or bubbling river&mdash;in that flat
country!). This is too much even for him and
his times, and so he adds, &ldquo;but how likely let
others see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Our &ldquo;Tons&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stones.&rdquo;</span></span></h2>
<p>As given in <i>Kelly&rsquo;s Kent Directory</i>, our Tons

Street, Wilderton, Willington Street, Wilmington,
Wootton (three)&mdash;147 in all. One may add,
for purposes of investigation, Stone, an old
borough in Maidstone.</p>
<p>First, one must endeavour to separate the tons
and the stones&mdash;the Saxon settlements or towns
and the places named from stones set for boundaries
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
or for marks where manor courts or motes
were held. And this is not always easy, since
medi&aelig;val spelling was vague, and in some cases
an original &ldquo;stone&rdquo; has become &ldquo;ton&rdquo; in later
years, or <i>vice versa</i>. Generally, a reference to
the earliest forms (where such can be found in
Saxon or Norman, or even Early English documents)
will settle the point. Thus Folkestone
is by some identified with the site of the &ldquo;stone
of inscription on the Gallic sea,&rdquo; mentioned by
Nennius, the Saxon geographer. It is Folcesstane
in the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i>, and Falchestan in
Domesday, and therefore no explanation involving
ton need be entertained. Keston, again, is
Cystaninga, hence in Saxon charters between
862 and 966, as being or having a boundary
mark stone. It is Chestan in Domesday. But
Chiddingstone should probably lose its final e
and derive from a Saxon patronymic, although
a modern and grotesque suggestion is that the
dolmen there was used as a Chiding or judgment
stone by Celtic or Saxon priests. Maidstone,
again, should probably be Maidston, being
Medwegston in the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i>, and almost
certainly meaning the town on the Medway; although
it is fair to say that an ending in stane
is early found. Tilmanstone was earlier Telmeston,
and Elmstone was Elmerston, and the
earlier spellings of Goodnestone are Goodwinston,
Gudewynston, and Goodneston.</p>
<p>Stones are much fewer than &ldquo;tons,&rdquo; although
no doubt the number of such marks (origin of
our milestones) was increased by the Romans.
Thus the place Stone, two miles west of Faversham
and on their great main road Watling
Street, is thought to mark the site of their
military station of Durolevo, and thus to be
named from the distance mark. We must also
note that stone bridges were practically unknown
to the Saxons, except those the Romans had left,
and Stone Cross would not appear as a place-name
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
until after their conversion, while a stone
house, except as the castle of a Norman noble,
would be of quite late date.</p>
<p>As to the Tons, some are named from geographical
position, such as Norton (Northtown),
near Faversham, and the Suttons (South-town),
on the edge of the Weald or south of Dartford;
and, whatever may be the case with others, the
Milton near Sittingbourne is called Middeltuna
in the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i> and in Domesday, since
it was reckoned the central town of Kent when
Watling Street was far the greatest and most
frequented route to be considered, being 42 miles
from London and 31 from Dover. Our various
Boughtons are &ldquo;settlements in the wood,&rdquo; as
are also the Woottons. Monkton and the Prestons
were settlements of monks and of colleges of
priests.</p>
<p>The great majority, however, denote the
settlement of some Saxon (<i>i.e.</i> Jutish) family,
such as Seafings or Sevingas at Sevington, the
&AElig;lings at Allington, the Noningas at Nonington,
the Cennings at Kennington, and so forth.
We find this Saxon patronymic &ldquo;ing&rdquo; in 37 of
our Kentish place names ending in ton, and
when we add the ings like Barming (Bamling,
Barmelinge, and Berblinge in Early English
documents), Beltring, Bilting, Birling, Bobbing
(Bobing-seata in a Saxon charter of 798&mdash;compare
Bobbingsworth in Essex), Bramling.
Bazing (at the junction of Kent, Sussex and
Surrey), reminds us of Basing and Basingstoke
in Hants and Basingham (in Domesday Book) in
Sussex. Charing, Chevening (although this
may be earlier and Celtic), Cooling, Detling,
perhaps Drelingore, Eastling, Etching, Garlinge,
Geddinge, Hacklinge, Hailing, Hawkinge,
Hucking, Kemsing, Lidsing (not Lyminge, however),
Mailing, Nullinge, Ospringe, Ottinge,
Pedlinge, Postling, Ratling, Rawling, Reading
Street (three), Rowling, Ruckinge, Sandling
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
(two), Selling, Sellinge, Shelving, Spratling
Street, Stelling, Stowting, Weavering Street,
Welling, Witchling, and Yalding; and when to
these we add the &ldquo;inghams&rdquo; I have given in a
previous article, we might alter Tennyson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Saxon, and Norman, and Dane are we,&rdquo; into
&ldquo;Mostly Saxon are we as to our place-names in
Kent.&rdquo; Our two Charltons are of old Ceorletone&mdash;the
town of the ceorls or husbandmen. Some
&ldquo;tons&rdquo; come from personal names also, <i>e.g.</i>,
Cuxton (compare Cuckfield in Sussex), Cuca and
its diminutive Cucola are found as Anglo-Saxon
names, and as Cockstane the place appears in
Domesday, and as Cokelstone in 1472, nearly
400 years later, with other forms Cockston,
Coklestane, Cukelestane, Cookstone, etc. (all
pointing to stone, and not ton, being properly
the final syllable).</p>
<p>There is, however, obviously much to be done
before we can know&mdash;or even in some cases
guess&mdash;as to the origin of some &ldquo;tons&rdquo; or
&ldquo;stones.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c13"><span class="sc">Our &ldquo;Hams.&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p>In considering the three score and ten, or
more, place-names in Kent which end in
<i>ham</i>, we are met with the initial difficulty that
there are two Saxon words Ham&mdash;home, and
Hamm&mdash;land drained by dykes, an East Friesian
word, though the far more common Ham is the
Teutonic heim, familiar as a suffix in Germany,
which in Picardy becomes hen, and in Friesland
um. Either ton or ham as a suffix after <i>ing</i>
denotes where a Saxon family or clan had settled
and made its toun or heim. Thus the P&aelig;fings
made a Pevington in Kent and a Pavingham in
Bedfordshire, and the Aldings an Aldington in
Kent and Worcester, and an Aldingham in
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
Lancashire, the Leasings a Lossingham in Kent
and a Lissington in Lancashire. Such instances
do not uphold what some have held&mdash;that there
were two words spelled the same, the one
meaning home and the other an enclosure.</p>
<p>As to the Hamm or Haam for marshy ground,
it would seem to be found in Kent as accounting
for Ham Ponds, near Sandwich, marshy ground
dear to botanists, and Mersham (A.S. Mersc&mdash;marsh)
in Romney, and Merston (Merxton in
74), near Rochester. Ham Green and Ham
Street are also Romney Marsh names. Waterham
and Wetham would suggest the same
origin, the latter being in the Rainham marshes
and the former, I think, not far from the Faversham
marshes. Dagenham also (as elsewhere) is
Decca&rsquo;s marsh land. But the ordinary hams,
as we may call them, have again to be subdivided
into those which indicate the settlement
of a Saxon family; those which enshrine a personal
name; and those which relate to the environment
or situation of the home.</p>
<p>In the first division would came the cases in
which ham followed the patronymic ing, denoting
&ldquo;the sons of.&rdquo; Thus Gillingham (Gelingham in
Domesday) was the settlement of the Gillings,
who are also found at Gilling in Yorkshire, Gillingham
in Norfolk, and Gillingham in Dorset.
The home of the Mottings was at Mottingham,
and that of the Leasings at Lossenham. Our
Chilham would not at first sight seem to come
in here; but in a charter of King Wihdraed in
699 it is called &ldquo;Cilling,&rdquo; and in another of 814
&ldquo;the port which is called Cillincg&rdquo; (the Stour
was then navigable up to here for small craft),
and a manor in Chilham is Shillingfield, so that
a connection with the Gillings may be suggested.
Farningham might seem <i>prima facie</i> to add
another to this unexpectedly small class; but
there is no known tribe of Farnings, and the old
name was Fremyngham (again with no tribe
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
name to support it). It has been suggested that
it derives from the A.S. Frem or foreign, and
denotes a settlement of foreigners (possibly
Danes) coming from the Thames up the Darenth
valley.</p>
<p>In the second division we might place any
hams recording the personal names of those who
founded them. Here Isaac Taylor may err in
saying: &ldquo;In the Anglo-Saxon charters we frequently
find this suffix united with the names of
families&mdash;never with those of individuals.&rdquo; In
this he follows Leo in his <i>Anglo Saxon Names</i>.
And yet on another page (compare p. 331 with
p. 131) he gives a list of places derived from the
names of individuals. But certainly Godmersham
and Rodmersham suggest personal names, and
no one has ascribed any other origin to Harrietsham,
which, even down to the fifteenth century,
appears as Heryotesham. In one probably
illiterate will of 1594 it is called &ldquo;Henry Etisham
alias Harrysam,&rdquo; the latter being no doubt the
vernacular pronunciation. So surely Meopham
is Mepa&rsquo;s Home. No letter o appeared in the
name before or during the 14th century, when
Simon de Mepham was Archbishop of Canterbury.
It is a modern intrusion, left unpronounced.
Icelham, McClure gives as meaning
the Home of Icel, like Icelsham in Sussex, thus
contravening the dictum of Taylor and Leo as to
personal names. So Offham, and probably
Otham, is said by the learned <i>Sussex Place-Names</i>
to be named after King Offa, who had such
power and made such great benefactions to the
Church in Sussex and Kent. Finglesham, called
Flenguessa in Domesday and Fengesham in 1206,
suggests a person rather than a family when the
common ing is not then found in the name, and
so does Wittersham, especially in its old forms
of Westricheshamme and Witrychesham.
Faversham was Febres-ham in 811 (Charters
and Rolls), and Febresham in 858. In Domesday
(1086) it appears as Faversham, and as to
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
this McClure, a great recent authority in Saxon,
says: &ldquo;The first element is a personal name in
the genitive.&rdquo; As, however, there seems to be
no similar Saxon designation, he suggests a
possible survival of the Latin Faber, <i>i.e.</i>, Smith,
in a thoroughly Latinized part of Kent. But
this pre-supposes that the place was named from
a single unnamed operative. Betsham is
obscure, but when we find, also in Kent, Betshurst
and Betteshanger, a personal origin seems
likely. As McClure says, our Luddesdown seems
to involve a personal name; he might say the
same of Luddenham.</p>
<p>The third division introduces us to settlements
or homes named from their environment or
situation. Thus Higham (Heahhaam in a
charter of 770, and Hehham in one of 774), is
plainly from the A.S. Heah, whence our High;
and so is Hougham (earlier Hugham), near
Dover. Burham is the fortified place or Burh,
found in 1498 as Borowham, in 1511 as Borougham,
and in 1549 in its present form. Homes
between Rochester and Aylesford had to be
strong in the days and the place of constant
maraudings and wars. Mersham is the Mersc
home in Romney Marsh. Westerham, of old
Ostreham (compare Westenhanger alias Ostringhanger)
is the little white &ldquo;home in the west&rdquo; of
Kent. Ickham&mdash;Ioccham in a charter of 785,
in Andrededa&mdash;otherwise Yeckham, is probably
the settlement on the yoke of arable land, from
the Saxon measure Yeok. Chartham (Certeham
in Domesday) is the home in the forest, chart and
hart being varying forms of the Teutonic word
for forest, the former more common in England,
the latter in Germany. Perhamsted, says
McClure, is the homestead where pears were
cultivated. Thornham (though Turnham in
Domesday) is said to derive from Hawthorns,
Thynne being Saxon for thorn, and haegathorn
later for hedge-thorn&mdash;whence also probably our
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
Kentish Eythorne (anciently Hegythe Thorne),
and Eyhorne (Haythorne in Plea of Henry III.),
as place-names. Weald, Wold, Wald, and Wood
(A.S., Wudu and Weald), all mean woods, so
that we can understand our Wouldham and
Waltham. Lenham must be the settlement of
the Len, unless it could be proved that the river
ever had another name, Celtic as it probably is.</p>
<p>The following is a full list of the &ldquo;Hams&rdquo; in
Kent according to <i>Kelly&rsquo;s Directory of Kent</i>,
and I have extracted them in the hope that it
may save some trouble to a future writer on our
place-names. I am not of the class of those who
say: &ldquo;Posterity has done nothing for me, so
why should I do anything for posterity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adisham, Alkham, Barham, Bagham, Beckenham,
Burham, Bentham, Betsham, Bayham,
Cudham, Cobham, Clapham, Chatham, Chartham,
Chilham, Crowdleham, Crockham, Dagenham,
Eltham, Elham, Fawkham, Faversham,
Farningham, Finglesham, Frogham, Godmersham,
Gillingham, Ham ponds, Ham Green
(two), Ham Hill, Ham Street, Heverham, Ham,
Harrietsham, Hougham, Higham, Horsham,
Ickham, Ightham, Lenham, Luddenham, Lossenham,
Meopham, Mersham, Mongeham, Mottingham,
Newnham, Offham, Otham, Otterham,
Petham, Peckham, Rayham, Rainham, Rodmersham,
Sydenham, Shoreham, Teynham, Thornham,
Waltham, Waterham, Wetham, Wickham,
Wickhambreux, Westerham, Wrotham,
Wingham, Wittersham, Wouldham, Yaldham.
Kilburne wrote that there were 49, but here I
enumerate 71, and one might add Perhamsted,
Iselham, Freckenham, Mistelham, and the Hundreds
of Kinghamford and Downhamford, making
77, all of undoubtedly Saxon origin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<h3 class="inline" id="c14"><span class="sc">Our &ldquo;Soles,&rdquo; &ldquo;Burys,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hithes.&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p>The word Sole occurs frequently as a Kentish
place-name, and is purely Saxon. Dr. Bosworth&rsquo;s
<i>Anglo-Saxon Dictionary</i> gives Sol
as meaning &ldquo;soil&mdash;dirt&mdash;a wallowing place&rdquo;;
while Lewis defines it as &ldquo;a dirty pond of standing
water.&rdquo; The Saxon verb is Sylian, &ldquo;to soil
or cover with mud.&rdquo; So an old Kentish will has
the words &ldquo;beside the wateringe sole in trend
(<i>i.e.</i>, the end) of Yckhame streete.&rdquo; Now, as
the chief industries of the Saxons in Kent were
pigs and pots&mdash;as now they are bricks and beer&mdash;it
is obvious that pigs, especially in clay soil,
would create many wallowing places. So we find
Sole Street, near Broadstairs (now corrupted
into Sorvell and so made unmeaning and unintelligible),
another by Cobham, another by
Crundale, and another by Selling. We find also
Bradsole (S. Radigund&rsquo;s near Dover), Buttsole
in Eastry, Blacksole at Wrotham, Maidensole,
Longsole Heath by Allington, Thewsole, and
Hangmansole in Romney Marsh, Eastsole, Newsole
near Coldred, Esole near Nonington, Podsole
near Headcorn, a Mote-sole Street in Sandwich,
Mudshole by Hawkinge, Barnsole Lane,
Gillingham, Capel Sole, Barnsole in Staple,
Westfield Sole in Boxley, Rigsol Road in Otterden,
and last, but not least, Paddisole, or Padsole,
at Maidstone.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Our &ldquo;Burys.&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p>There are two Anglo-Saxon words which have
to be distinguished&mdash;Beorh, like the German
Berg, meaning a hill; and Buruh or Byrig,
which comes later into the suffix Bury, which
again later comes to be used for a division of
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
Hundred or simply for a town. In the south of
England we have most of the distinctively Saxon
or Jutish Bury, while in the north we have the
Anglian and Norse forms of Burgh, Brough,
Borough, more common. And one must add,
as a variant of the same word, Barrow, which
in modern use we confine to a tumulus for the
sepulture of a great warrior or leader. As these
British camps were generally on high ground for
observation and for defence, the ideas represented
by Beorh and by Buruh would inevitably
intertwine. The British and Saxon camps were
no doubt numerous when we consider the centuries
of marauders and invaders which kept our
earliest forefathers in a constant fear. They
were usually round or oblong, whereas the fewer
and later camps or forts of the Romans were
rectangular. Surrounded by a deep ditch, the
earth of which was thrown up to make a wall,
into them in troublous times were collected
families and flocks, so that the transition of
meaning from the Byrig or fort to the Borough
or town was easy. Canterbury, for example,
began as Cantwara-byrig, the fort of the folk of
Kent, long before it developed into its most important
borough or city. So, in another county,
Gl&aelig;stingaberig became Glastonbury.</p>
<p>In Kent we find Farnborough, Frindsbury,
Wateringbury, Hildenborough, Pembury, Cobhambury,
Southborough, Oldbury, Bigbury,
Glassenbury, two Hawkenburies, Holborough,
Howbury, Scadbury, Goodbury, Eastbury, Fallburie,
Stockbury (where the ditch and bank had
been supplemented by a palisade of stocks, the
predecessor of our fathers&rsquo; cheveaux de frise in
warlike defence), Binbury, Westborough (in
Maidstone above and defending the Medway),
Woodnesbury, Willesborough, Queenborough,
Richborough, Bidborough, Marshborough,
Statenborough, Tattlebury, Downbury, Hockenbury,
Dunbury and Tatlingbury&mdash;a long list
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
which predicates long years, or rather centuries,
of fighting in defence, as much as my previous
list of forestal names proves how much of Kent
was covered with woods.</p>
<p>Some of these, like Oldbury and Bigbury, are
undoubtedly old British camps or forts; others
were adapted, or newly made, by Romans and,
later, by Saxons, while again later still a
Norman castle might be reared on the old
strategic spot, as in the case of Thornham
Castle, near me. Flinders Petrie, however, says
that &ldquo;many sites which by their name of bury
suggest a camp or fort are now bare of remains.&rdquo;
So he writes after examining Downbury Farm,
near Pembury, Hockenbury, and Dunbury, near
Staplehurst, Tattlebury near Headcorn, Tatlingbury
near Capel, Perry Hill near Cooling, Pembury,
Frindsbury and Wateringbury.</p>
<p>Our Barrows in Kent are mainly small, graves
rather than mounds, but we have the place-names
Barrow Green, Barrow Hill near Ashford,
and Barrow Hill by Sellindge.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Our &ldquo;Hithes.&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p>Hithe is the Saxon for haven, or place where
ships could lie, and Hythe (Heda in Domesday
Book, and Hee in a deed of 1229) was near the
edge of the sea when history begins; but West
Hythe, which is now three miles from the sea,
was the old port used by the Romans and by
them called Limene, the harbour. Hence our
modern Lympne&mdash;Portus Lemanis, in which the
p is a modern addition. I find it Limene in 1291,
Lymen in 1396, Limne in 1475, and Lymne in
1480.</p>
<p>Then, right in the Weald, is the hamlet of
Smallhythe, three miles south of Tenterden.
Down to 1509, however, there was a channel
from the sea up to here.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Newheth, or New Hythe, is a hamlet of East
Malling&mdash;and it was a sort of port (or perhaps a
wharf) on the Medway for shipping goods from
South Kent and the Weald.</p>
<p>On the Thames, below Dartford, is Greenhithe,
which has kept both its name and the
justification thereof from the times of the Saxons
to the present day. There the Danish King had
an entrenched camp as a winter station for his
soldiers. Here William the Conqueror was
stopped by the men of Kent until he confirmed
them in their old Saxon laws and privileges. From
here Sir John Franklin and Captain Crozier
sailed in the Erebus and Terror (in the year and
month of my birth) on their last and fatal voyage
to the Pole. Here still the hithe discharges its
lime and chalk, and has an environment and
background of green fields and woods.</p>
<p>&AElig;rrehythe, &ldquo;the old haven,&rdquo; known to us as
Erith, the landing place for what was from 1178,
when it was founded, the important Abbey of
Lesnes, which still gives its name to the Hundred.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c15"><span class="sc">Our &ldquo;Cold Harbours.&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p>Perhaps the most common place-name in
England is that of Cold Harbour; though
Sutton and Norton may run it close. Over
one hundred and seventy have been enumerated
in England, a number which would be brought
up to over two hundred if we added the Caldecots
and the Calcotts (we have a Calcott in
Sturry parish) which are names with the same
meaning. And yet in a sense Cold Harbour is
not a place-name, for the only parish of that
name was not formed and named until 1842. It
is near Dorking. However, as a name of a
manor or a farm it is common. Thus in London
(where we should hardly expect Cold Harbours
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
of the kind found in country places) there was
the Manor of Coldherberghe, of which we know
much since 1327. Situated on the bank of the
Thames near London Bridge, its mansion was
tenanted by royal dukes, a bishop, a Lord
Mayor, and afterwards became the Hall of the
Watermen&rsquo;s Company, and at last the City of
London Brewery. The other is in Camberwell,
which was one great manor at the time of the
Conquest, but later divided into minor lordships,
to two of which the name of Cold Harbour was
given, of which one was Cold Herbergh,
Hachesham (Hatcham now), while the other
survives in the well known Cold Harbour Lane,
in Camberwell. In early 19th century maps Cold
Blow Farm was the representative of the old
manor (Kent has a Cold Blow in Bexley). A
curious 15th century corruption was Coldabbeye,
though there was never an abbey there. The
farm succumbed to suburban expansion in the
19th century; but Harbour Road, Cold Harbour
Lane, and Cold Harbour Place, tell us of its
site.</p>
<p>The Cold Harbours in Kent are thirty in
number, while ten are found in each of the contiguous
counties of Surrey and Sussex. They
are found at Addington, Aldington, Aylesford,
Barham Downs, Bishopsbourne, Bridge, Chislehurst,
Deptford, Ditton, Eltham, Higham, Hildenborough,
Eltham, Lamberhurst, Lymne,
Maidstone, Newington, Northfleet, Penshurst,
Sellinge, Sittingbourne, Stoke-in-Hoo, Sutton-at-Hone,
Tenterden, Trench, Tunbridge, Woodnesborough,
Woolwich, Wrotham, and Wye.
The majority of these are upon or near Roman
sites, or on the Roman main roads, a fact to be
borne in mind when we come to consider their
origin. For Isaac Taylor says of early travelling:
&ldquo;Where no religious house existed to receive
the traveller he would usually be compelled to
content himself with the shelter of bare walls.
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
The ruins of deserted Roman villas were no
doubt so used, and such places seem commonly
to have borne the name of Cold Harbour. In
the neighbourhood of ancient roads we find no
less than seventy, and about a dozen more bearing
the analogous name of Caldecot or &lsquo;cold
cot.&rsquo;&rdquo; His figures have now been shown to
be very much under the mark. So Forbes and
Burmester, in their <i>Our Roman Highways</i>,
say: &ldquo;The appearance of such names is believed
to be a sure indication of the use in comparatively
modern times of Roman buildings for
purposes of temporary shelters; and the occasional
discovery of tessellated pavements injured
by fires lighted in the corners of rooms suggests
their utilization by wayfarers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not that all would have been villas or private
residences. The orderly and practical Romans
on their great military roads had a colonia at
each 15 or 20 miles with a mansio or government
posting station, and between each, at about
five miles distance, was a mutatio with less
accommodation, and used by a humbler class.
The manager of each was called a Strator&mdash;like
our Way Warden. In many cases we find that
the Cold Harbours come exactly where we
should look for the regularly set mutatio. The
same kind of arrangement is found in the Hans
or Khans of the East, which provide shelter for
traveller and stabling for his horse or other
beast of burden; but no bed or food. Analogous
also are the dak-bungalows familiar to us in
India.</p>
<p>The name, however, is pure Saxon, like the
German Kalt Herberg, and the surviving French
Auberge for a small place of rest and refreshment.
Mr. Unthank, a friend and church-worker
of mine in Walworth, enlisted my interest
in the name a dozen years ago, and since he has
written learnedly on the subject in <i>Notes and
Queries</i> (1914) and the <i>Home Counties Magazine</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
(1912). He calls them &ldquo;the leanest shadows of
our cheerful inns,&rdquo; and though bare walls and
a bit of a roof would be better than nothing to a
traveller over Barham Downs, yet, compared
with the &ldquo;warmest welcome in an inn&rdquo;
experienced elsewhere, he would no doubt call
it a cold harbour. Later, and in Middle English,
the Heribeorg, shelter for a host, became as
Herberg a synonym for any inn, and later still
Harbourers or harbingers were the caterers or
victuallers, who at last gained the right to sell
ale in competition with the more normal
hostelries. Then the trade-name became a surname,
and John le Herberger appears, and
perhaps the Harpers of to-day indicate an innkeeper
rather than a musician as their ancestor.</p>
<p>Of course, the perverse ingenuity of some has
invented strange derivations for the name. Stow
suggests that they were coal-stations! Another
writer (who apparently only knew of one Cold
Harbour near London Bridge) that it was where
the K&ouml;ln or Cologne merchants had their headquarters!
Another derives from Col (ubris)
arbor&mdash;the tree or staff round which a serpent
twines. This is the emblem of Mercury the
messenger of Jupiter, and may have been therefore
the sign of the Roman posting-stations!</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c16"><span class="sc">Anderida.</span></h3>
<p>As I have already said, Kent was once mainly
either dense prim&aelig;val forest, or marshland,
which fringed nearly all its coastal
border from Sussex to London. The greater part
of the forest was that which extended along the
northern border of the South Saxons with a
breadth of thirty and a length of one hundred
and twenty miles. But the royal forest of Blean
(in which I was born) is continuous with
Anderida, although it bears a separate name in
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
a charter of King Offa in 791. This would make
the forestal land extend from Whitstable through
East and Mid Kent, Northern Sussex, Southern
Surrey, and Eastern Hampshire, right down to
Petersfield. Distinct, but contiguous, was the
Cestmwarowalth or Cestersetta Wald, of which
part remains in the woods between Rochester
and Maidstone, although some would place it
near Lyminge.</p>
<p>This prim&aelig;val forest is still marked by a great
survival of woodland and parks, as a coloured
map of Kent would show, and also by the
abundance of the characteristic terminations of
burst, den, ley, holt, and feld. It names the
Weald (Teutonic Wad&mdash;wood), although therein
more cleared than anywhere else, and the less
known Roman road, Well Street, which ran
through it from Maidstone, should be probably
the Wald road.</p>
<p>Generally called Anderida from the name the
Romans gave to their fort and garrisoned place
near Pevensey, this is only a change from the
earlier Andred. Coed-Andred was its Celtic
name, from Coed, a wood, which word appears
also in Ked Coed (the hollow dolman in the
wood), which was corrupted into Kits Coty
House; while the Cotswolds give the Saxon
addition to the Celtic name, so that the meaning
is Wood-wood, just as Durbeck or the Ravensbourne
mean Water-water by the Saxon surnaming
of a Celtic name. In early Saxon
charters, which are written in Latin, it appears
as Saltus-Andred, Silva-Andred, Saltus communis,
or Silva regalis, while in Saxon it is
Andred, Andredsleage, or Andredsweald.</p>
<p>As to the meaning of the name, Edwards
thinks it a proper name, which is very improbable
considering its extent. Lambarde says
Andred in the Celtic means great, which is
simplest and best, provided that such a word is
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
proved to exist. Dr. Guest refers it, less probably,
to a Celtic negative an and dred, a dwelling,
and Lewin to &ldquo;an&rdquo; for the &ldquo;deni,&rdquo; for oak-forest,
and by a &ldquo;dhu&rdquo; for black.</p>
<p>It may be here interesting to give a list of the
names borne nearly a thousand years ago by
some towns and villages in Kent, especially
those in the Weald. In a map in Furley&rsquo;s
<i>Weald</i>, he gives the manors and places mentioned
in the Domesday Book (A.D. 1086), and
by this it appears that settlements and cultivation
were nearly all on the north and east edges
of the great forest of Anderida. The only exceptions
are Tivedale (now Tudely), Benindene
(Benenden), Tepindene (Tiffenden), and
Belicedene, which are deeper in the forest.</p>
<p>Taking the line of the Kentish Weald from
west to east, we find fringing the prim&aelig;val
wood, Distreham (Westerham), Briestede
(Brasted), Sondresse (Sundridge), Brotenham
(Wrotham), Nargourde (Mereworth), Pecheham
(W. Peckham), Pecheham (East Peckham),

(Ulcombe), Boltone Archiepiscopi (B. Malherbe),
Bogelei (Bewley in B. Malherbe), Piventone
(Pevington), Pluckelei (Pluckley), Rotinge (Roting
in Pluckley), Litecert (Little Chart), Certh
Mill, Certh (Great Chart), Eshetesford or Estefort
(Ashford), Merseham (Mersham), Aldingtone
(Aldington), Limes (Lymne), Boningtone
(Bonnington), Bilsvitone (Bilsington), Rochinges
(Ruckinge), Orleverstone (Orleston), Werahorne
(Warehorne), Tintintone Dene (Tinton in Warehorne),
Apeldres (Appledore), Palestre (Palster
in Wittersham), Newedene (Newenden).</p>
<p>In the rest of Chenth (Kent) the chief places
mentioned in Domesday were Bromlei (Bromley),
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
Lolingstone (Lullingstone), Tarenteforte (Dartford),
Gravesham (Gravesend), Rovescestre
(Rochester), Esledes (Leeds), Scapige (Sheppey),
Favershant (Faversham), Wi (Wye), Goversham
(Godmersham), Cantuaria (Canterbury),
Forewic (Fordwich), Roculf (Reculver), Tanet
(Thanet), Sandwice (Sandwich), Estrei (Eastry),
Addelam (Deal), Douere (Dover), Fulchestan
(Folkestone), Heda (Hythe), and Romene
(Romney).</p>
<p>One thing that strikes one at once is the proof
any list of Kentish villages gives of the forestal
character of Kent. As one of my aims is to save
trouble on the part of some future writer who
shall produce the long overdue History of
Kentish Place-Names, I will here transcribe all
which indicate a woodland origin. About a few
I am doubtful, but probably others which I have
in ignorance left out would balance them. There
are in this list 20 of the characteristic dens,
although far more survive as the names of
manors or now uninhabited parts; there are 15
hursts and 35 woods&mdash;some of the last being
no doubt modern as names of places. I make
174 of these forestal names as under:&mdash;</p>

<h2 id="c17"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Land Divisions of Kent.</span></span></h2>
<p>Uninterruptedly from Saxon times
Kent has been divided into districts called
Lathes, and these into Hundreds, and
these again into Borowes or Townes, the last
being in Kent synonymous and used to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
exclusion of the name parish down to the times
of Elizabeth.</p>
<p>First, as to the meanings and uses of these
three words.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Lathe</span> takes us back to the Saxon L&aelig;th for
land, and in Latin documents appears as Lestus
or Lastus, <i>e.g.</i>, &ldquo;In Lasto Sanctii Augustini&rdquo;
in a deed of 1347. Lambarde, however, derives
it from a verb gelathian, to assemble; while
Latham, following the German writer Zeuss, says
the Terr&aelig; l&oelig;tic&aelig; were lands given to the L&oelig;ti.
L&oelig;ti is the Roman form of Leute, <i>i.e.</i>, People,
<i>i.e.</i>, the Teutonic mercenaries who were imported
to defend the Litus Saxonicum&mdash;the eastern and
south-eastern coast&mdash;which was especially open
to the attacks of Scandinavian pirates. The
abstruse and involved explanation will hardy
be preferred. It is a purely Kentish word.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Hundred.</span>&mdash;This familiar word, first found in
the Laws of King Edgar, 1000 A.D., comes
from the old High German (Allemannisch),
Huntare or Huntre. The Huntares in N. Europe
were the sub-divisions of the Gau, the primary
settlement with independent jurisdiction, a word
to be traced in such place-names as Spengay
and Wormegay, and even in Ely, for its earliest
form was Eligabirig. But why Hundred? Some
say each contained an hundred hides of land
(but hundreds vary much in size). Some say
each was a district wherein 100 soldiers had to
be forthcoming in war&mdash;this approves itself to
Lambarde and Spelman. Some refer it to the
original settlement of 100 Jutish warriors, as
sub-divisions of the Teutonic army which conquered
the Britons. Brampton thinks each was
to contain 100 villages. But in view of the historical
and legal use of the word one may prefer
the number of the freeholders in an area as constituting
the Hundred. Thus the great legal
authority, Blackstone, says: &ldquo;As 10 families of
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
freeholders made a town or tithing, so 10 tithings
made an Hundred.&rdquo; Each had its Hundred
Court for civil and criminal jurisdiction; each
its Hundred man or constable; each its Hundred
Mote or assembly or parliament; each its Hundred-penny,
or local tax on and in the Hundred.
Most English counties were, and are, divided
into Hundreds, wapentakes, or wards. So
Caxton, writing in 1485, says: &ldquo;In Yorkshire
ben xxii hondredes.&rdquo; Of these words Wapentake
indicates the defensive military organisation
of the Danish intruders, and Hundred the more
peaceful settlements of Jutes and Saxons. A
synonym peculiar to Sussex is the word Rape,
the origin of which is said to be that lands seized
by the Conqueror were plotted out by the hrepp
or rope.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Tithings</span> were the divisions of the Hundred
or Wapentake or Ward or Rape, and the term
is used in most counties. But in Kent Borowe or
Ton or Towne is used instead. A Tything, Freeburgh
or Decennary, was a district containing ten
householders, who were answerable to the King
for each other&rsquo;s good behaviour. Each tything
formed a little commonwealth, and chose its
own dean (decanus or chief man of ten) or head,
who was sometimes called Alderman on account
of his age and experience. Most commonly,
however, he was called the Borsholder from the
Anglo-Saxon Bohr a surety, and Ealder, head or
chief. The members of each tything formed a
court of justice in which disputes were heard.
Right down to 1836 the inhabitants of an Hundred
where damage was done were each liable
to pay compensation for it. The tendency of
small bodies to take petty and shortsighted
views in social matters is evidenced in John
Bunyan&rsquo;s <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, where, quoting a
much earlier proverb, he speaks of &ldquo;Mr. Penny-wise-pound-foolish,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Mr. Get-i&rsquo;-th&rsquo; Hundred
and lose i&rsquo; the Shire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Originally there were seven Lathes in Kent&mdash;Borowart,
Estrei, Middletune, Wiwarlet, Limowart,
Sudtone, and Elesford, of which the first
five covered East Kent and the last two West
Kent. Each derived its name from the chief
town in each. Those in East Kent had previously
been Roman Villas or towns, while Sutton-at-Hone
and Aylesford were of great antiquity.</p>
<p>Later Borowart and Estrei were united under
the name of S. Augustine&rsquo;s, and Middletune and
Wiwarlet together formed the Lathe of Sherwinhope,
which again, by the addition of the Seven
Hundreds of the Weald and the Hundred of
Marden, received its present territory and name
of the Lathe of Scray.</p>
<p>One finds also a Lestus de Hedelynge containing
the three Hundreds of Eastry, Quernilo
and Beawesberghe. In this district an old wood
in Waldershare is still Hedlinge.</p>
<p>Since the time of Henry the Third there have
been but five Lathes, named S. Augustine&rsquo;s,
Shepway, Scray, Aylesford, and Sutton-at-Hone.</p>
<p>Now as to their names.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Borowart</span>, Boro-wara-lest, was named from
Canterbury, the chief borough in Kent, and so
means the people of the borough, the chief one.
Later it was named from S. Augustine&rsquo;s Abbey
in Canterbury, to which a great part of the land
in the Lathe belonged.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Estrei</span>, or Estre Last, named from the
ancient town of Eastry (which may enshrine the
name of the Saxon goddess of Spring, Eastre&mdash;whence
our Easter, from the Christian festival
coinciding in time with the heathen festival) was
absorbed into the Lathe of S. Augustine.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Middletune</span> (Middeltuna both in the <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i> and in Domesday) is our Milton
by Sittingbourne, and is said to be named from
being the central town of Kent, as it was then
populated and of importance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Wiwarlet</span> (Wi-wara-lest), the lest of the
people of Wye, together with Middletune,
became later part of the Lathe of Sherwinhope
(Scrawynghop, temp. Hen. 3, and Shewynghope
1347). This name was later changed into that
of Scray. What is the meaning of Sherwinhope?
Hope in Saxon denotes a river valley,
and Sands, in his <i>Memorials of Old Kent</i>,
speaks of the brook Sherway, which falls into
the Beult. But what of Scray?</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Limowart</span>, or Limea, denotes the people of
Lymne, the old Roman Portus Lemanis, called
Limene in 1291, then Lymene, Lymen 1396,
Limne 1475, and Lymne 1480. I do not find
the intrusive and erroneous p in the name earlier
than 1504. The name was changed to Shippeway
or Shipway, temp. Henry III., and a place
in Lymne is still called Shipway Cross.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Sudtone</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, the town south of Dartford,
distinguished from other Suttons by the later
addition of &ldquo;at Hone,&rdquo; which is said to mean
low in the valley.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Elesford</span>, our Aylesford, is so spelled in
Domesday, but in the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i> it is
Egelsford, and in Nennius Egisford. It may
very well have been named by the Saxons after
the Teutonic hero-archer or demigod Eigil,
though the Celtic Eglwys, a church, has been
suggested. It also appears as &AElig;gelesthrep, and
for this a personal name (<i>e.g.</i>, Ecglaf), with
threp or thorp for town has been suggested. But
thorp we get from the Danes, and find chiefly
in the N.E. There are none in Kent.</p>
<p>The place-name difficulty, however, is intensified
when we find, according to Lambarde
in 1570, 13 Hundreds in S. Augustine&rsquo;s, 14 in
Shepway, 18 in Scray, 14 in Aylesford, and 8 in
Sutton-at-Hone, many of them being long
obsolete names, such as Cornilo in S. Augustine&rsquo;s,
Franchesse in Shepway, Calehill in
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
Scray, Eythorde in Aylesford, and Coddeshethe
in Sutton-at-Hone. And then in some places
there are Half-Hundreds, which, however, did
not exist before the reign of Edward II.</p>
<p>As a matter of nearer local interest I may
quote the divisions and assessments in the time
of the Black Prince of the boroughs of the
Hundred of Maydstone.</p>

<p>I do not understand the omission of the
borough of Week or Wyke&mdash;whence Week

remains in Week Street, unless it was then
included in Boxley.</p>
<hr />
<p>The study of the place-names of a county (as
has been well done for our neighbour Sussex)
mainly confines itself to the derivation and
meaning of existing towns and villages, rivers,
and hills, and I have done little more in these
notes. But the subject is not then exhausted,
for there is much of great interest to be gathered
from the names of Hundreds, of Manors, and
even of separate farms, and their consideration
would largely extend the enquiry. For example,
the Hundred Eyhorne in 1347 had the manors
of Herbyltone (Harbledown in Harrietsham),
Rissheforde in Hedcorne, Bromfield and Ledes,
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>

Stockberye, Langele, Bygnor, Aldington
Cobham, Otteham, B. Monchelsey alias Westboltone,
West Farnebourne, Shelve in Lenham,
Leneham, Downe, Berghestede, Bugeley,
Cherletone, and Bressinge, many of these names
being very unfamiliar now.</p>
